## Introduction

Over the last few years, Python has gained popularity thanks to the numerous libraries (packages with pre-written functions) in the field of machine learning, statistical data analysis, and bioinformatics. While a few years ago, it was often necessary to go to R for performing routine data manipulation and analysis tasks, nowadays Python has a vast ecosystem of libraries. Libraries exist for many different file formats that you might encounter in metagenomics, such as fasta, fastq, sam, bam, etc.

This tutorial/walkthrough will provide a short introduction to the most popular libraries for data analysis [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). This library has functions for reading and manipulating tabular data similar to the `data.frame()` in R together with some basic data plotting codes.

The aim of this walkthrough is to first: get familiar with the Python code syntax and use Jupiter Notebook for executing codes and secondly get a kickstart to utilising the endless possibilities of data analysis in Python that can be applied to your data.  

## Working in a jupyter environment

This tutorial run-through is using a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) for writing & executing Python code and for annotating.

Jupyter notebooks are convenient and have two types of cells: **Markdown** and **Code**. The **markup cell** syntax is very similar to **R markdown**. The markdown cells are used for annotating, which is important for sharing code with collaborators, reproducibility, and documentation.

To load, please run the following command from within the chapter's directory.

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

The in the folder tree, navigate to the `python-pandas_lecture` directory, and then open the `student-notebook.ipynb`. 

You can then follow that notebook, which should mirror the contents of this chapter! Otherwise try making a new notebook within Jupyter `File > New > Notebook`!

::: {.callout-tip}
If you get stuck on solutions to the tasks in the Jupyter notebook, the answers should be in the corresponding 'Solutions' chapter on this page.
:::

A few examples are shown below. For a full list of possible syntax [click here](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watson-studio-local/1.2.3?topic=notebooks-markdown-jupyter-cheatsheet) for a Jupyter Notebook cheat-sheet.  

list of **markdown cell** examples:

::: {.callout-note}
In many cases, there are multiple possible syntaxes which give the same result. We present only one way in this run-through.
:::

Text

- `**bold**` : **bold**
- `*italics*` : *italics*

Code

- \`inline code\` : `inline code`
 
 LaTeX maths

- `$ x = \frac{\pi}{42} $` : $$ x = \frac{\pi}{42} $$

\
The **code cells** can interpret many different coding languages including Python and Bash. The syntax of the code cells is the same as the syntax of the coding languages, in our case python. 

Below are some examples of Python **code cells** with some useful basic python functions:

::: {.callout-tip}
## Python function
`print()` is a python function for printing lines in the terminal
`print() == echo ` in bash
:::

```python
print("Hello World from Python!")
```
*out -* `Hello World from Python!`

But it can also, for example, run bash commands by adding a *!* at the start of the line.

```python
! echo "Hello World from bash!"
```
*out -* `Hello World from bash!`

Stings or numbers can be stored as a variable by using the *=* sign

```python
i = 0
```
Ones a variable is set in one **code cell** they are stored and can be accessed in other downstream **code cells**.

```python
print(i)
```

You can also print multiple things together in one `print` statement such as a number and a string:

```python
print("The number is", i, "Wow!")
```
*out -* `The number is 0 Wow!`

## Pandas
### Getting started
Pandas is a Python library used for data manipulation and analysis.

We can import the library like this:

```python
import pandas as pd
```

::: {.callout-note}
We set "pandas" to the alias "pd" because we are lazy and don't want to write the full word too many times.
:::

Now, we can print the current version:

```python
pd.__version__
```
*out -* `'2.0.1'`

### Pandas data structures
The primary data structures in Pandas are `Series` and `DataFrame`.

A `DataFrame` is a table with **columns** and **rows**. 

Each **column** has a *column name* and each **row** has an *index*.


![](assets/images/chapters/python-pandas/01_table_dataframe.svg)

A single row or column (1 dimensional data) is a `Series`.

## Reading data with Pandas

Pandas can read in **csv** (comma separated values) files, which are tables in text format.

It's called **c**sv because each value is separated from the others via a comma, like this:

```{text}
A,B
5,6
8,4
```

*out -* 
<table border="1" class="dataframe" style="width:10%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;dataframe">
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>A</th>
    <th>B</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>4</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Another common tabular separator are **tsv**, where each value is separated by a **tab** `\t`

```{text}
A\tB
5\t6
8\t4
```

>Our dataset `"all_data.tsv"` is tab separated, which Pandas can handle using the `sep` argument.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Pandas function
`pd.read_csv()` is the pandas function to read in tabular tables. The `sep=` can be specified argument, `sep=,` is the default.
:::

```python
df = pd.read_csv("../all_data.tsv", sep="\t")
df
```

<table border="1" class="dataframe">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style="text-align: right;">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>ID</th>\n      <th>Year_Birth</th>\n      <th>Education</th>\n

## Data exploration

The data is from a customer personality analysis of a company trying to better understand how to modify their product catalogue. Here is the [link to the original source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis) for more information. 

### Columns

The command below prints all the column names.

```python
df.columns
```
```
Index(['ID', 'Year_Birth', 'Education', 'Marital_Status', 'Income', 'Kidhome',
       'Teenhome', 'MntWines', 'MntFruits', 'MntMeatProducts',
       'MntFishProducts', 'MntSweetProducts', 'MntGoldProds',
       'NumWebPurchases', 'NumCatalogPurchases', 'NumStorePurchases',
       'NumWebVisitsMonth', 'Complain', 'Z_CostContact', 'Z_Revenue'],
      dtype='object')
```

We can also list their respective data types.

- `int64` are integers
- `float64` are floating point numbers, also called `double` in other languages
- `object` are Python objects, which are strings in this case

```python
df.dtypes
```
```
ID                       int64
Year_Birth               int64
Education               object
Marital_Status          object
Income                 float64
Kidhome                  int64
Teenhome                 int64
MntWines                 int64
MntFruits                int64
MntMeatProducts          int64
MntFishProducts          int64
MntSweetProducts         int64
MntGoldProds             int64
NumWebPurchases          int64
NumCatalogPurchases      int64
NumStorePurchases        int64
NumWebVisitsMonth        int64
Complain                 int64
Z_CostContact            int64
Z_Revenue                int64
dtype: object
```
### Inspecting the DataFrame

What is the size of our `DataFrame`

```python
df.shape
```
```
(1754, 20)
```
It has **1754** rows and **20** columns.

Let's look at the first 5 rows:

```python

What we can see it that, unlike **R**, **Python** and in extension **Pandas** is 0-indexed instead of 1-indexed.

### Accessing rows and columns

We can access parts of the data in `DataFrames` in different ways.

The first method is sub-setting the rows using the index.

This will take only the second row and all columns, producing a `Series`:

```python
df.loc[1, :]
```
```
ID                           2174
Year_Birth                   1954
Education              Graduation
Marital_Status             Single
Income                    46344.0
Kidhome                         1
Teenhome                        1
MntWines                       11
MntFruits                       1
MntMeatProducts                 6
MntFishProducts                 2
MntSweetProducts                1
MntGoldProds                    6
NumWebPurchases                 1
NumCatalogPurchases             1
NumStorePurchases               2
NumWebVisitsMonth               5
Complain                        0
Z_CostContact                   3
Z_Revenue                      11
Name: 1, dtype: object
```

And this will take the second and third row, producing another `DataFrame`:

```python
df.loc[1:2, :]
```

<table border="1" class="dataframe">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style="text-align: right;">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>ID</th>\n      <th>Year_Birth</th>\n      <th>Education</th>\n      <th>Marital_Status</th>\n      <th>Income</th>\n      <th>Kidhome</th>\n      <th>Teenhome</th>\n      <th>MntWines</th>\n      <th>MntFruits</th>\n      <th>MntMeatProducts</th>\n      <th>MntFishProducts</th>\n      <th>MntSweetProducts</th>\n      <th>MntGoldProds</th>\n      <th>NumWebPurchases</th>\n      <th>NumCatalogPurchases</th>\n      <th>NumStorePurchases</th>\n      <th>NumWebVisitsMonth</th>\n      <th>Complain</th>\n      <th>Z_CostContact</th>\n      <th>Z_Revenue</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>2174</td>\n      <td>1954</td>\n      <td>Graduation</td>\n      <td>Single</td>\n      <td>46344.0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>11</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>6</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>6</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>11</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>4141</td>\n      <td>1965</td>\n      <td>Graduation</td>\n      <td>Together</td>\n      <td>71613.0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>426</td>\n      <td>49</td>\n      <td>127</td>\n      <td>111</td>\n      <td>21</td>\n      <td>42</td>\n      <td>8</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>10</td>\n      <td>4</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>11</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>

It's important to understand that almost all operations on `DataFrames` are not in-place, meaning that we don't modify the original object and would have to save the results to the same or a new variable to keep the changes.

This, for example will create a new `DataFrame` of only the "Education" and "Marital_Status" columns.

```python
new_df = df.loc[:, ["Education", "Marital_Status"]]
new_df
```
'<table border="1" class="dataframe">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style="text-align: right;">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>Education</th>\n      <th>Marital_Status</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>Graduation</td>\n      <td>Single</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>Graduation</td>\n      <td>Single</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>Graduation</td>\n      <td>Together</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>Graduation</td>\n      <td>Together</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>Master</td>\n      <td>Together</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>...</th>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1749</th>\n      <td>Graduation</td>\n      <td>Together</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1750</th>\n      <td>Graduation</td>\n      <td>Married</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1751</th>\n      <td>Graduation</td>\n      <td>Married</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1752</th>\n      <td>Graduation</td>\n      <td>Divorced</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1753</th>\n      <td>Master</td>\n      <td>Together</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>1754 rows × 2 columns</p>'

Selecting only one column by name:

```python
df["Year_Birth"]
```
```
0       1957
1       1954
2       1965
3       1984
4       1967
        ... 
1749    1977
1750    1974
1751    1967
1752    1981
1753    1956
```

We can also remove columns from the `DataFrame`.

In this case, we want to remove the columns `Z_CostContact` and `Z_Revenue` and keep those changes.

```python
df = df.drop("Z_CostContact", axis=1)
df = df.drop("Z_Revenue", axis=1)
```

### Conditional subsetting

We can more specifically look at subsets of the data we might be interested in.

This subsetting is a bit weird in the syntax at first but hopefully makes more sense when we go through it step by step.

We can, for example, test each string in the column `Education` if it is equal to `PhD`:


```python
education_is_grad = (df["Education"] == "Graduation")
education_is_grad
```
```
0        True
1        True
2        True
3        True
4       False
        ...  
1749     True
1750     True
1751     True
1752     True
1753    False
Name: Education, Length: 1754, dtype: bool
```

We can also check for multiple conditions at once:

```python
two_at_once = (df["Education"] == "Graduation") & (df["Marital_Status"] == "Single")
two_at_once
```
```
0        True
1        True
2       False
3       False
4       False
        ...  
1749    False
1750    False
1751    False
1752    False
1753    False
Length: 1754, dtype: bool
```

This will create a `Series` of booleans, which can then be used to subset the data to rows where the condition(s) are **True**:

```python
df[two_at_once]

The syntax that seems more complicated and does it in one step without the extra `Series` is this:

```python
df[(df["Education"] == "Master") & (df["Marital_Status"] == "Single")]
```

## Describing a DataFrame

Pandas can easily create overview statistics for all numeric columns:

```python

You can also directly calculate the relevant statistics on columns you are interested in:

```python
df["MntWines"].max()
```
```
1492
```
```python
df[["Kidhome", "Teenhome"]].mean()
```
```
Kidhome     0.456100
Teenhome    0.480616
dtype: float64
```

For non-numeric columns, you can get the represented values or their counts:

```python
df["Education"].unique()
```
```
array(['Graduation', 'Master', 'Basic', '2n Cycle'], dtype=object)
```

```python
df["Marital_Status"].value_counts()
```
```
Marital_Status
Married     672
Together    463
Single      382
Divorced    180
Widow        53
Alone         2
Absurd        2
Name: count, dtype: int64
```

Subset the `DataFrame` in two different ways:

::: {.callout-tip}
Just like with the "PhD" string before, you can subset using integers and $<$, $>$, $<=$ and $>=$.
:::


- One where everybody is born before 1970

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Answer"}

```python 
df_before = df[df["Year_Birth"] < 1970]
```
:::

- One where everybody is born in or after 1970

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Answer"}

```python 
df_before = df[df["Year_Birth"] >= 1970]
```
:::

- How many people are in the two `DataFrames`? 

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Answer"}

```python 
print("n(before)   =", df_before.shape[0])
print("n(after)   =", df_before.shape[0])
```
```
n(before)   = 804
n(after)   = 950
```

:::

- Do the total number of people sum up to the original `DataFrame` total?

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Answer"}

```python
 df_before.shape[0] + df_after.shape[0] == df.shape[0]
```
True

```python 
print("n(sum)      =", df_before.shape[0] + df_after.shape[0])
print("n(expected) =", df.shape[0])
```
```
n(sum)      = 1754
n(expected) = 1754
```

## Dealing with missing data

We can check for missing data for each cell like this:

```python
df.isna()
```

By summing over each row, we see how many missing values are in each column.

`True` is treated as `1` and `False` as `0`.

```python
df.isna().sum()
```
```
ID                      0
Year_Birth              0
Education               0
Marital_Status          0
Income                 19
Kidhome                 0
Teenhome                0
MntWines                0
MntFruits               0
MntMeatProducts         0
MntFishProducts         0
MntSweetProducts        0
MntGoldProds            0
NumWebPurchases         0
NumCatalogPurchases     0
NumStorePurchases       0
NumWebVisitsMonth       0
Complain                0
dtype: int64
```

We don't really know what a missing value means so we are just going to keep them in the data.

However, we could remove them using `df.dropna()`

### Grouping data

We can group a `DataFrame` using a categorical column (for example `Education` or `Marital_Status`).

This allows us to do perform operations on each group individually.

For example, we could group by `Education` and calculate the mean `Income`:

```python
df.groupby(by="Education")["Income"].mean()
```
```
Education
2n Cycle      47633.190000
Basic         20306.259259
Graduation    52720.373656
Master        52917.534247
Name: Income, dtype: float6
```

##  Combining data

### Concatenation

One way to combine multiple datasets is through **concatenation**, which either combines all columns or rows of multiple `DataFrames`.

The command to combine two `DataFrames` by appending all rows is `pd.concat([first_dataframe, second_dataframe])`

- Is there anything weird about the new `DataFrame` and can you fix that?

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Answer"}

We previously removed the columns "Z_CostContact" and "Z_Revenue" but they are in the new data again.

We can remove them like before:

```python 
concat_df = concat_df.drop("Z_CostContact", axis=1)
concat_df = concat_df.drop("Z_Revenue", axis=1)
concat_df
```

There's two people that have "YOLO" as their Marital Status ...]

### Merging

Analysing numbers can be easier than analysing categorial values, like "PhD" and "Master".

To make our like easier, we might want to have a new column when the Education level is replaced with a number that "ranks" the Education levels by how long it takes.

This information could be stored in a Python `Dictionary` (Also called Hash Map in other languages), which stores **key** and **value** pairs.

We could store the Education information like this:

```python
education_dictionary = {
    "Basic": 1,
    "2n Cycle": 2,
    "Graduation": 3,
    "Master": 4,
    "PhD": 5
}
```
We can now convert this `Dictionary` to a `DataFrame`:

```python
education_df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(education_dictionary, orient="index")
education_df
```
<table border="1" class="dataframe">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style="text-align: right;">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>0</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Basic</th>\n      <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2n Cycle</th>\n      <td>2</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Graduation</th>\n      <td>3</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Master</th>\n      <td>4</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>PhD</th>\n      <td>5</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>

The resulting `DataFrame` has the Education level as index and the column 0 has the level information.

We can rename the column to "Level".

```python
education_df = education_df.rename(columns={0: "Level"})
education_df
```
<table border="1" class="dataframe">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style="text-align: right;">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>Level</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Basic</th>\n      <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2n Cycle</th>\n      <td>2</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Graduation</th>\n      <td>3</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Master</th>\n      <td>4</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>PhD</th>\n      <td>5</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>

We can now **merge** this new `education_df` with our previous `concat_df`.

The left `DataFrame` is `concat_df` and we merge on "Education" because that's where the Eduction information is.

The right one is `education_df` and the information is in the index.

```python
merged_df = pd.merge(left=concat_df, right=education_df, left_on="Education", right_index=True)
merged_df

## Data visualization

We can easily create simple graphs using `DataFrame.plot()`.

This uses the package **matplotlib** in the background, which is a very powerful and popular plotting library but is not the most user friendly.

Using this **Pandas** method is very easy and can be a good way to do some initial exploratory plots and later refine them using either pure **matplobib** or another library.

### Histogram

We can plot the data from a `DataFrame` like this:

`kind` specifies the kind of plot (for example *hist* for histogram, *bar* for bar graph or *scatter* for scatter plot).

We usually specify the columns from which the `x` and `y` components should be taken, but for a histogram we only need to specify one.

```python
ax = merged_df.plot(kind="hist", y="Income")
ax.set_xlabel("Income")
ax.set_title("Histogram of income")
```
Text(0.5, 1.0, 'Histogram of income')

![png](https://github.com/Kevinnota/teaching_stuff/blob/main/histogram.png?raw=true)

::: {.callout-tip title="Task" appearance="simple"}

This doesn't look very good because the x-axis extends so much!

- Looking at the data, can you figure out what might cause this?

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Answer"}

When we look at the highest earners, we see that somebody put *666666* as their income.

We can assume that this was put as a joke or is an outlier.

In either way, we can redo the plot with that datapoint removed.
:::

- Can you "fix" the plot?

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Answer"}

```python
ax = merged_df[merged_df["Income"] != 666666].plot(kind="hist",y="Income")
ax.set_xlabel("Income")
ax.set_title("Fixed Histogram of income")
```
Text(0.5, 1.0, 'Fixed Histogram of income')

![png](https://github.com/Kevinnota/teaching_stuff/blob/main/fixed_histogram.png?raw=true)

### Bar plot

Another visualization we could do is a bar plot.

Using the `groupby` and `mean` methods, we can calculate the mean Income like we've learned before.

```python
grouped_by_education = merged_df.groupby(by="Education")["Income"].mean()
grouped_by_education

```
```
Education
2n Cycle      47633.190000
Basic         20306.259259
Graduation    52720.373656
Master        52917.534247
PhD           56145.313929
Name: Income, dtype: float64
```
Now, this data can be shown:

```python
ax = grouped_by_education.plot(kind="bar")
ax.set_ylabel("Mean income")
ax.set_title("Mean income for each education level")
```
Text(0.5, 1.0, 'Mean income for each education level')

![png](https://github.com/Kevinnota/teaching_stuff/blob/main/bar_plot.png?raw=true)

### Scatter plot

Another kind of plot is the scatter plot, which needs two columns for the **x** and **y** axis.

```python
ax = df.plot(kind="scatter", x="MntWines", y="MntFruits")
ax.set_title("Wine purchases and Fruit purchases")
```
Text(0.5, 1.0, 'Wine purchases and Fruit purchases')

![png](https://github.com/Kevinnota/teaching_stuff/blob/main/scatter_polt_01.png?raw=true)

You can also specify whether the axes should be on the log scale or not.

```python
ax = df.plot(kind="scatter", x="MntWines", y="MntFruits", logy=True, logx=True)
ax.set_title("Wine purchases and Fruit purchases, on log scale")
```
Text(0.5, 1.0, 'Wine purchases and Fruit purchases, on log scale')

## Plotnine

Plotnine is the Python clone of ggplot2, which is very powerful and is great if you are already familiar with the ggplot2 syntax!

```python
from plotnine import *
```
```python
(ggplot(merged_df, aes("Education", "MntWines", fill="Education"))
 + geom_boxplot(alpha=0.8))
```
![png](https://github.com/Kevinnota/teaching_stuff/blob/main/boxplot.png?raw=true)


```python
(ggplot(merged_df[(merged_df["Year_Birth"]>1900) & (merged_df["Income"]!=666666)],
        aes("Year_Birth", "Income", fill="Education"))
 + geom_point(alpha=0.5, stroke=0)
 + facet_wrap("Marital_Status"))
```

**task**

Now that you are familiar with python, pandas, and plotting. There are two data.tables from **AncientMetagenomeDir** which contains metadata from metagenomes. You should, by using the code in the tutorial be able to explore the datasets and make some fancy plots.

```
file names:
sample_table_url
library_table_url
```

## (Optional) clean-up

Let's clean up your working directory by removing all the data and output from this chapter.

When closing your `jupyter` notebook(s), say no to saving any additional files.

Press <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> on your terminal, and type <kbd>y</kbd> when requested. 
Once completed, the command below will remove the `/<PATH>/<TO>/python-pandas` directory **as well as all of its contents**. 

::: {.callout-tip}
## Pro Tip
Always be VERY careful when using `rm -r`. Check 3x that the path you are
specifying is exactly what you want to delete and nothing more before pressing
ENTER!
:::

```bash
rm -r /<PATH>/<TO>/python-pandas*
```

Once deleted you can move elsewhere (e.g. `cd ~`).

We can also get out of the `conda` environment with

```bash
conda deactivate
```
