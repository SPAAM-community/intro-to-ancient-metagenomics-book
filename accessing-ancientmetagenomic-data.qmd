## Introduction

In most bioinformatic projects, we need to include publicly available comparative data to expand or compare our newly generated data with.

Including public data can benefit ancient metagenomic studies in a variety of ways. It can help increase our sample sizes (a common problem when dealing with rare archaeological samples) - thus providing stronger statistical power. Comparison with a range of previously published data of different preservational levels can allow an estimate on the quality of the new samples. When considering solely (re)using public data, we can consider that this can also spawn new ideas, projects, and meta analyses to allow further deeper exploration of ancient metagenomic data (e.g., looking for correlations between various environmental factors and preservation).

Fortunately for us, geneticists and particularly palaeogenomicists have been very good at uploading raw sequencing data to well-established databases [@Anagnostou2015-mz].

In the vast majority of cases you will be able to find publically available sequencing data on the [INSDC](https://www.insdc.org/) association of databases, namely the [EBI's European Nucleotide Archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/) (ENA), and [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) or [DDBJ's](https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/dra/index-e.html) Sequence Read Archives (SRA). However, you may in some cases find ancient metagenomic data on institutional FTP servers, domain specific databases (e.g. [OAGR](https://oagr.org)), [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org), [Figshare](https://figshare.com), or [GitHub](https://github.com).

But while the data is publicly available, we need to ask whether it is 'FAIR'.

## Finding Ancient Metagenomic Data

[FAIR principles](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18) were defined by researchers, librarians, and industry in 2016 to improve the quality of data uploads - primarily by making data uploads more 'machine readable'. FAIR standards for:

- Findable
- Accessible
- Interoperable
- Reproducible

When we consider ancient (meta)genomic data, we are pretty close to this. Sequencing data is in most cases accessible (via the public databases like ENA, SRA), interoperable and reproducible because we use field standard formats such as FASTQ or BAM files. However _findable_ remains an issue.

This is because the _metadata_ about each data file is dispersed over many places, and very often not with the data files themselves.

In this case I am referring to metadata such as: What is the sample's name? How old is it? Where is it from? Which enzymes were used for library construction? What sequencing machine was this library sequenced on?

To find this information about a given data file, you have to search many places (main text, supplementary information, the database itself), for different types of metadata (as authors report different things), and also in different formats (text, tables, figures.

This very heterogenous landscape makes it difficult for machines to index all this information (if at all), and thus means you cannot search for the data you want to use for your own research in online search engines.

## AncientMetagenomeDir

This is where the SPAAM community project '[AncientMetagenomeDir](https://github.com/spaam-community/AncientMetagenomeDir)' comes in [@Fellows_Yates2021-rp]. AncientMetagenomeDir is a resource of lists of metadata of all publishing and publicly available ancient metagenomes and microbial genome-level enriched samples and their associated libraries.

By aggregating and standardising metadata and accession codes of ancient metagenomic samples and libraries, the project aims to make it easier for people to find comparative data for their own projects, appropriately re-analyse libraries, as well as help track the field over time and facilitate meta analyses.

Currently the project is split over three main tables: host-associated metagenomes (e.g. ancient microbiomes), host-associated single-genomes (e.g. ancient pathogens), and environmental metagenomes (e.g. lakebed cores or cave sediment sequences).

The repository already contains more than 2000 samples and 5000 libraries, spanning the entire globe and as far back as hundreds of thousands of years.

To make the lists of samples and their metadata as accessible and interoperable as possible, we utilise simple text (TSV - tab separate value) files - files that can be opened by pretty much all spreadsheet tools (e.g., Microsoft Office excel, LibreOffice Calc) and languages (R, Python etc.) (@fig-accessingdata-exampledirtable).

![Example few columns and rows of an AncientMetagenomeDir table, including project name, publication year, site name, latitude, longitude, country and sample name.](assets/images/chapters/accessing-ancientmetagenomic-data/fig-accessingdata-exampledirtable.png){#fig-accessingdata-exampledirtable}

Critically, by standardising the recorded all metadata across all publications this makes it much easier for researchers to filter for particular time periods, geographical regions, or sample types of their interest - and then use the also recorded accession numbers to efficiently download the data.

At their core all different AncientMetagenomeDir tables must have at 6 minimum metadata sets at the sample level:

- Publication information (doi)
- Sample name(s)
- Geographic location (e.g. country, coordinates)
- Age
- Sample type (e.g. bone, sediment, etc.)
- Data Archive and accessions

Each table then has additional columns depending on the context (e.g. what time of microbiome is expected for host-associated metagenomes, or species name of the genome that was reconstructed).

The AncientMetagenomeDir project already has 9 major releases, and will continued to be regularly updated as the community continues to submit new metadata of samples of new publications as they come out.

## AMDirT

But how does one explore such a large dataset of tables with thousands of rows? You could upload this into a spreadsheet tool or in a programming language like R, but you would still have to do a lot of manual filtering and parsing of the dataset to make it useful for downstream analyses.

In response to this The SPAAM Community have also developed a companion tool 'AMDirT' to facilitate this. Amongst other functionality, AMDirT allows you to load different releases of AncientMetagenomeDir, filter and explore to specific samples or libraries of interest, and then generate download scripts, configuration files for pipelines, and reference BibTeX files for you, both via a command-line (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI)!

### Running AMDirT viewer

We will now demonstrate how to use the AMDirT graphical user interface to load a dataset, filter to samples of interest, and download some configuration input files for downstream ancient DNA pipelines.

![AMDirT logo: a cog with the SPAAM icon in the middle with the word AMDirT to the side](assets/images/chapters/accessing-ancientmetagenomic-data/fig-accessingdata-amdirtlogo.png){#fig-accessingdata-amdirtlogo fig-align="center"}

::: {.callout-warning}
This tutorial will require a web-browser! Make sure to run on your local laptop/PC or, if on on a server, with X11 forwarding activated.
:::

First, we will need to activate a conda environment, and then install the latest development version of the tool for you.

While in the `accessing-ancientmetagenomic-data` conda environment, run the following command to load the GUI into your web-browser. If the browser doesn't automatically load, copy the IP address and paste it in your browser's URL bar.

```bash
AMDirT viewer
```

:::{.callout-note}
The first time opening AMDirT (a streamlit app), it may ask you to sign up for a newsletter using your email.

Do not type anything when prompted (i.e., just press <kbd>enter</kbd>), this is entirely optional and will not affect the usage of the tool.

You will not be asked again when in the same conda environment.
:::

Your web browser should now load, and you should see a two panel page.

Under **Select a table** use the dropdown menu to select 'ancientsinglegenome-hostassociated'.

You should then see a table (@fig-accessingdata-firstpage), pretty similar what you are familiar with with spreadsheet tools such as Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice calc.

![Main AMDirT Viewer page on load. A toolbar on the left displays the AMDirT version, and dropdown menus for the AncientMetagenomeDir release, table, and downloading tool to use. The rest of the page shows a tabular window containing rows and columns corresponding to sample metadata and rows of samples with metadata such as project name, publication year and site name.](assets/images/chapters/accessing-ancientmetagenomic-data/fig-accessingdata-firstpage.png){#fig-accessingdata-firstpage fig-align="center"}

To navigate, you can scroll down to see more rows, and press <kbd>shift</kbd> and scroll to see more columns, or use click on a cell and use your arrow keys (<kbd>⬆</kbd>,<kbd>⬇</kbd>,<kbd>⬅</kbd>,<kbd>➡</kbd>) to move around the table.

You can reorder columns by clicking on the column name, and also filter by pressing the little 'burger' icon that appears on the column header when you hover over a given column.

As an exercise, we will try filtering to a particular set of samples, then generate some download scripts, and download the files.

First, filter the **project_name** column to 'Muhlemann2020' from [@Kocher2021-vg, @fig-accessingdata-projectfilter].

![The AMDirT viewer with a filter menu coming out of the project name column, with an example search of the project 'Kocher 2021' in the search bar.](assets/images/chapters/accessing-ancientmetagenomic-data/fig-accessingdata-projectfilter.png){#fig-accessingdata-projectfilter fig-align="center"}

Then scroll to the right, and filter the **geo_loc_name** to 'Norway'  (@fig-accessingdata-geofilter).

![The AMDirT viewer with a filter menu coming out of the geo location column, with an example search of the country 'United Kingdom' written in the search bar and the entry ticked in the results.](assets/images/chapters/accessing-ancientmetagenomic-data/fig-accessingdata-geofilter.png){#fig-accessingdata-geofilter fig-align="center"}

You should be left with 2 rows.

Finally, scroll back to the first column and tick the boxes of these four samples (@fig-accessingdata-tickbox).

![The AMDirT viewer with just four rows with samples from Kocher2021 that are located in the United Kingdom being displayed, and the tickboxes next to each one selected](assets/images/chapters/accessing-ancientmetagenomic-data/fig-accessingdata-tickbox.png){#fig-accessingdata-tickbox fig-align="center"}

Once you've selected the samples you want, you can press **Validate selection** below the table box. You should then see a series loading-spinner, and new a lot of buttons should appear (@fig-accessingdata-validated)!

![The AMDirT viewer after pressing the 'validate selection' button. A range of buttons are displayed at the bottom including a warning message, with the buttons offering download of a range of files such as download scripts, AncientMetagenomeDir library tables and input configuration sheets for a range of ancient DNA bioinformatics pipelines](assets/images/chapters/accessing-ancientmetagenomic-data/fig-accessingdata-validated.png){#fig-accessingdata-validated fig-align="center"}

You should have four categories of buttons:

- Download AncientMetagenomeDir Library Table
- Download Curl sample download script
- Download **\<tool/pipeline name\>** input TSV
- Download Citations as BibText

The first button is to download a table containing all the AncientMetagenomeDir metadata of the selected samples. The second is for generating a download script that will allow you to immediately download all sequencing data of the samples you selected. The third set of buttons generate (partially!) pre-configured input files for use in dedicated ancient DNA pipeline such as nf-core/eager [@Fellows_Yates2021-jl], PALAEOMIX [@Schubert2014-ps], and/or and aMeta [@Pochon2022-hj]. Finally, the fourth button generates a text file with (in most cases) all the citations of the data you downloaded, in a format accepted by most reference/citation managers. In this case the reference metadata for that particular publication isn't publicly available so there is a warning.

It's important to note you are not necessarily restricted to [Curl](https://curl.se/) for downloading the data. AMDirT aims to add support for whatever tools or pipelines requested by the community. For example, an already supported downloading tool alternative is the [nf-core/fetchNGS](https://nf-co.re/fetchngs) pipeline. You can select these using the drop-down menus on the left hand-side.

For the next step of this tutorial, we will press the following buttons:

- Download AncientMetagenomeDir Library Table
- Download Curl sample download script
- Download nf-core/eager input TSV
- Download Citations as BibText

Your browser should then download two `.tsv` files, one `.sh` file and one `.bib` file into it's default location.

:::{.callout-note}
Do not worry if you get a 'Citation information could not be resolved' warning! This is occasionally expected for some publications due to a CrossRef metadata information problem when requesting reference information about a DOI.
:::

Once this is done, you can close the tab of the web browser, and in the terminal you can press <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> to shutdown the tool.

### Inspecting AMDirT viewer Output

Lets look at the files that AMDirT has generated for you.

First we should `mv` our files from the directory that your web browser downloaded the files into into somewhere safer.

To start, we make sure we're still in the chapter's data directory, and move move the files into it.

```bash
mv ~/Downloads/AncientMetagenomeDir_* /<path>/<to>/accessing-ancientmetagenomic-data/
```

:::{.callout-warning}
The default download directory normally something like `~/Downloads/`), however may vary on your machine!
:::

Then we can look inside the chapter's directory. We should see the following five files

```bash
ls
```
```default
AncientMetagenomeDir_bibliography.bib
AncientMetagenomeDir_curl_download_script.sh
AncientMetagenomeDir_filtered_libraries.csv
AncientMetagenomeDir_nf_core_eager_input_table.tsv
ancientsinglegenome-hostassociated_samples_Muhlemann2020_Norway.tsv
```

:::{.callout-tip}
AMDirT v1.4.6 has a bug where nf-core/mag files will also be generated whenever you download a file

These can be ignored, or deleted with the command `rm *_mag_*`
:::

We can simply run `cat` of the four files downloaded by AMDirT to look inside (the files starting with `AncientMetagenomeDir_`). If you run `cat` on the curl download script, you should see a series of `curl` commands with the correct ENA links for you for each of the samples you wish to download.

```bash
cat AncientMetagenomeDir_curl_download_script.sh
```

```default
#!/usr/bin/env bash
curl -L ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR409/005/ERR4093845/ERR4093845.fastq.gz -o ERR4093845.fastq.gz
curl -L ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR409/008/ERR4093838/ERR4093838.fastq.gz -o ERR4093838.fastq.gz

curl -L ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR409/009/ERR4093839/ERR4093839.fastq.gz -o ERR4093839.fastq.gz
curl -L ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR409/000/ERR4093860/ERR4093860_1.fastq.gz -o ERR4093860_1.fastq.gz
curl -L ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR409/007/ERR4093847/ERR4093847.fastq.gz -o ERR4093847.fastq.gz
```

By providing this script for you, AMDirT facilitates fast download of files of interest by replacing the one-by-one download commands for each sample with a _single_ command!

```bash
bash AncientMetagenomeDir_curl_download_script.sh
```

```
Running this command should result in progress logs of the downloading of the data of the four selected samples!

We can check the output by running `ls` to verify we have seven FASTQ files (five single end, and one paired end libraries).

Once the four samples are downloaded, AMDirT then facilitates fast processing of the data, as the _eager_ script can be given directly to nf-core/eager as input. Importantly by including the library metadata (mentioned above), researchers can leverage the complex automated processing that nf-core/eager can perform when given such relevant metadata.

```bash
cat AncientMetagenomeDir_nf_core_eager_input_table.tsv
```
```default

```

Finally, we can look into the BibTeX citations file (`*bib`) which will provide you with the citation information of all the downloaded data and AncientMetagenomeDir itself.

### AMDirT convert

If you're less of a GUI person and consider yourself a command-line wizard, you can also use the `AMDirT convert` command instead of the GUI version.

Make a new directory called `gui`, and change into it

```bash
mkdir gui && cd gui/
```

In this case you must supply your own filtered AncientMetagenomeDir samples table, and use command line options to specify which files to generate.

For example, lets say you used R to make the 'extra' file in our chapter directory (`ancientsinglegenome-hostassociated_samples_Muhlemann2020_Norway.tsv` - basically the same Muhlemann2020 et al. samples from Norway, as filtered in the GUI part of this tutorial). You would supply this to `AMDirT convert` as with the next command.

```bash
AMDirT convert -o . --bibliography --librarymetadata --curl --eager ../ancientsinglegenome-hostassociated_samples_Muhlemann2020_Norway.tsv ancientsinglegenome-hostassociated
```

You should see a few messages saying `Writing <XYZ>`, and then if we run `ls`, you should see the same resulting files as before with the GUI!

```bash
ls
```

```default
AncientMetagenomeDir_bibliography.bib
AncientMetagenomeDir_curl_download_script.sh
AncientMetagenomeDir_filtered_libraries.tsv
AncientMetagenomeDir_nf_core_eager_input_table.tsv
```

The convert command allowed you to say where to save the output files, use different flags to specify which scripts, bib, and configuration files you wish to generate, and finally your filtered AncientMetagenomeDir TSV file and which table it's derived from.

Therefore the `convert` command route of AMDirT allows you to include AMDirT in more programmatic workflows to make downloading data more efficiently.

## Git Practise

A critical factor of AncientMetagenomeDir is that it is community-based. The community curates all new submissions to the repository, and this all occurs with Git and GitHub.

The data is hosted and maintained on GitHub - new publications are evaluated on issues, submissions created on branches, made by pull requests, and PRs reviewed by other members of the community.

You can see the workflow in the image below from the AncientMetagenomeDir [publication](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-021-00816-y), and read more about the workflow on the AncientMetagenomeDir [wiki](https://github.com/SPAAM-community/AncientMetagenomeDir/wiki).

![Overview of the AncientMetagenomeDir contribution workflow. Potential publications are added as a GitHub issue where they undergo relevance evaluation. Once approved, a contributor makes a branch on the AncientMetagenomeDir GitHub repository, adds the new lines of metadata for the relevant samples and libraries, and once ready opens a pull request against the main repository. The pull request undergoes an automated consistent check against a schema and then undergoes a human-based peer review for accuracy against AncientMetagenomeDir guidelines. Once approved, the pull request is merged, and periodically the dataset is released on GitHub and automatically archived on Zenodo.](assets/images/chapters/accessing-ancientmetagenomic-data/fig-accessingdata-thedirworkflow.png){#fig-accessingdata-thedirworkflow fig-align="center" width="75%"}

As AncientMetagenomeDir is on GitHub, the means we can also use this repository to try out our Git skills we learnt in the chapter [Introduction to Git(Hub)](git-github.qmd)!

::: {.callout-tip title="Question" appearance="simple"}

Your task is to complete the following steps however with `git` terms removed (indicated by quotes). You should be able to complete the steps and also note down what the _correct_ Git terminology:

1. Make a 'copy' the [jfy133/AncientMetagenomeDir](https://github.com/jfy133/AncientMetagenomeDir) repository to your account

:::{.callout-note}
We are forking a personal fork of the main repository to ensure we don't accidentally edit the main AncientMetagenomeDir repository!
:::

2. 'Download' the 'copied' repo to your local machine
3. 'Change' to the `dev` branch
4. Modify the file `ancientsinglegenome-hostassociated_samples.tsv`. Add the following line to the end of the TSV. Make sure your text editor doesn't replace tabs with spaces!

	```tsv
	Long2022	2022	10.1038/s42003-022-03527-1	Basilica of St. Domenico Maggiore	40.848	14.254	Italy	NASD1	Homo sapiens	400	10.1038/s42003-022-03527-1	bacteria	Escherichia coli	calcified nodule	chromosome	SRA	raw	PRJNA810725	SRS12115743
	```

5. 'Send' back to Git(Hub)
6. Open a 'request' adding the changes to the original `jfy133/AncientMetagenomeDir` repo

## (Optional) clean-up

Let's clean up your working directory by removing all the data and output from this chapter.

When closing your `jupyter` notebook(s), say no to saving any additional files.

Press <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> on your terminal, and type <kbd>y</kbd> when requested. 
Once completed, the command below will remove the `/<PATH>/<TO>/accessing-metagenomic-data` directory **as well as all of its contents**. 

::: {.callout-tip}
## Pro Tip
Always be VERY careful when using `rm -r`. Check 3x that the path you are
specifying is exactly what you want to delete and nothing more before pressing
ENTER!
:::

```bash
rm -r /<PATH>/<TO>/accessing-metagenomic-data*
```

Once deleted you can move elsewhere (e.g. `cd ~`).

We can also get out of the `conda` environment with

```bash
conda deactivate
```

To delete the conda environment

```bash
conda remove --name accessing-ancientmetagenomic-data --all -y
```
