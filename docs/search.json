    "text": "Introduction\nAncient metagenomics applies cutting-edge metagenomic methods to the degraded DNA content of archaeological and palaeontological specimens. The rapidly growing field is currently uncovering a wealth of novel information for both human and natural history, from identifying the causes of devastating pandemics such as the Black Death, to revealing how past ecosystems changed in response to long-term climatic and anthropogenic change, to reconstructing the microbiomes of extinct human relatives. However, as the field grows, the techniques, methods, and workflows used to analyse such data are rapidly changing and improving.\nIn this book we will go through the main steps of ancient metagenomic bioinformatic workflows, familiarising students with the command line, demonstrating how to process next-generation-sequencing (NGS) data, and showing how to perform de novo metagenomic assembly. Focusing on host-associated ancient metagenomics, the book consists of a combination of theory and hands-on exercises, allowing readers to become familiar with the types of questions and data researchers work with.\nBy the end of the textbook, readers will have an understanding of how to effectively carry out the major bioinformatic components of an ancient metagenomic project in an open and transparent manner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you export the PDF or ePub versions of this book, some sections maybe excluded (such as videos, and embedded slide decks). Always refer to this website in doubt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe PDF/ePub version of the book is currently still under construction, and is likely misformatted and missing much of the content.

    "text": "Introduction to NGS Sequencing\nIn this chapter, we will introduce how we are able to convert DNA molecules to human readable sequences of A, C, T, and Gs, which we can subsequently can computationally analyse.\nThe field of Ancient DNA was revolutionised by the development of ‘Next Generation Sequencing’ (NGS), which relies on sequencing of millions of short fragments of DNA in parallel. The global leading DNA sequencing company is Illumina, and the technology used by Illumina is also most popular by palaeogeneticists. Therefore we will go through the various technologies behind Illumina next-generation sequencing machines.\nWe will also look at some important differences in the way different models of Illumina sequences work, and how this can influence ancient DNA research. Finally we will cover the structure of ‘FASTQ’ files, the most popular file format for representing the DNA sequence output of NGS sequencing machines.\n\n\nIntroduction to Ancient DNA\nThis chapter introduces you to ancient DNA and the enormous technological changes that have taken place since the field’s origins in 1984. Starting with the quagga and proceeding to microbes, we discuss where ancient microbial DNA can be found in the archaeological record and examine how ancient DNA is defined by its condition, not by a fixed age.\nWe next cover genome basics and take an in-depth look at the way DNA degrades over time. We detail the fundamentals of DNA damage, including the specific chemical processes that lead to DNA fragmentation and C-&gt;T miscoding lesions. We then demystify the DNA damage “smiley plot” and explain the how the plot’s symmetry or asymmetry is related to the specific enzymes used to repair DNA during library construction. We discuss how DNA damage is and is not clock-like, how to interpret and troubleshoot DNA damage plots, and how DNA damage patters can be used to authenticate ancient samples, specific taxa, and even sequences. We cover laboratory strategies for removing or reducing damage for greater accuracy for genotype calling, and we discuss the pros and cons of single-stranded library protocols. We then take a closer look at proofreading and non-proofreading polymerases and note key steps in NGS library preparation during which enzyme selection is critical in ancient DNA studies.\nFinally, we examine the big picture of why DNA damage matters in ancient microbial studies, and its effects on taxonomic identification of sequences, accurate genome mapping, and metagenomic assembly.\n\n\nIntroduction to Metagenomics\nThis chapter introduces you to the basics of metagenomics, with an emphasis on tools and approaches that are used to study ancient metagenomes. We begin by covering the basic terminology used in metagenomics and microbiome research and discuss how the field has changed over time. We examine the species concept for microbes and challenges that arise in classifying microbial species with respect to taxonomy and phylogeny. We then proceed to taxonomic profiling and discuss the pros and cons of different taxonomic profilers.\nAfterwards, we explain how to estimate preservation in ancient metagenomic samples and how to clean up your datasets and remove contaminants. Finally, we discuss strategies for exploring and comparing the ecological diversity in your samples, including different strategies for data normalization, distance calculation, and ordination.\n\n\nIntroduction to Microbial Genomics\nThe field of microbial genomics aims at the reconstruction and comparative analyses of genomes for gaining insights into the genetic foundation and evolution of various functional aspects such as virulence mechanisms in pathogens.\nIncluding data from ancient samples into this comparative assessment allows for studying these evolutionary changes through time. This, for example, provides insights into the emergence of human pathogens and their development in conjunction with human cultural transitions.\nIn this chapter we will look examples for how to utilise data from ancient genomes in comparative studies of human pathogens and today’s practical sessions will highlight methodologies for the reconstruction of microbial genomes.\n\n\nIntroduction to Evolutionary Biology\nPathogen genome data are an invaluable source of information about the evolution and spread of these organisms. This chapter will focus on molecular phylogenetic methods and the insight that they can reveal from improving our understanding of ancient evolution to the epidemiological dynamics of current outbreaks.\nThe first section will introduce phylognenetic trees and a set of core terms and concepts for their interpretation. Next, it will focus on some of the most popular approaches to inferring phylogenetic trees; those based on genetic distance, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference. These methods carry important considerations regarding the process that generated the data, computational capability, and data quality, all of which will be discussed here. Finally, we will direct our attention to examples of analyses of ancient and modern pathogens (e.g. Yersinia pestis, Hepatitis B virus, SARS-CoV-2) and critically assess appropriate choice of models and methods.",

    "text": "1.2 Basic structure of DNA\nSo first, to actually understand how sequencing works, we need to look at, just do a very, very briefly recap of what DNA is. So DNA, as you probably, everybody knows, is a double helix molecule which is stored in every single cell in your body (Figure 1.1).\nAnd this double helix is actually made up of four main components called nucleotides, which you can see here (Figure 1.2), and they consist of two strands in which these four nucleotides will come together and bind together in a particular order. And these four nucleotides are made up of two groups, pyrimidines and purines. So pyrimidines are cytosines and thiamines, and purines are guanines and adenines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Animation of 3D DNA double helix.

Source: Pradana Aumars, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd this base pairing, which brings the two strands of the DNA together, always consists of one pyrimidine and one pyrimine. I always remember which group go together, and so I remember it as C always goes with G, think CGI, and then go A with T. What’s some of the best CGI you’ve ever seen? It’s from Star Wars, so think AT-AT Walker (Figure 1.3), Antid Walker, you have been able to remember that. So what this means, and because they go together, it always means they’re complementary. So whenever you find a C on one strand of the DNA molecule, you will see a G on the other and vice versa, and again, A with a T on the other. So depending on which strand you are reading, you can always get the order of the base on the other strand because of this complementary base pairing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Lego construction of AT AT walker from Star Wars.

    "text": "1.3 DNA replication\nAnd this is important because this is essentially how replication occurs, so when you basically make a copy of the DNA strand. And in very simple terms, what we do is, or what the body does, is unwinds the multiple various macro structures, including double helix. You then separate the strands into two, so you have, all of your nucleotides are basically exposed, so you don’t have them binding together. And then you get an enzyme called DNA polymerase, which basically attaches onto the strands that’s reading along it, and when it finds an exposed nucleotide, it will say, well, okay, I recognize, for example, this is a C that’s being exposed, and it waits to basically pick up a free nucleotide floating around in the cellular gunk, and then basically allows it to bind together in that position. Then it basically will move along to the next exposed nucleotide, see what it is, let’s say it’s an A, and then it will basically wait to find the T and fix it on the strand, and eventually another enzyme, I believe, comes along, I can’t remember the name, I didn’t name this, comes along and basically repairs the backbone, like, no, it doesn’t matter, prepares the backbone to basically then have your two, strands from your original strand. And just remember basically having this enzyme picking up free nucleotides and adding it to the new strand, because this is the important thing the sequencing is within a minute.",

    "text": "1.4 Extracting DNA\n\nModern DNA\nAs a reminder, how we get DNA, so when you do this, you basically get your sample, you then have to break down the cells, the cell walls, and membranes, and then you basically have to destroy a lot of stuff inside the cell, there’s not the DNAs, things like RNAs, proteins, and things like this, because this can basically inhibit your DNA replication downstream in your molecular steps. You then separate out the DNA from the rest of the broken stuff, which you can then pull out (Figure 1.4). And normally in modern DNA, this can actually look like a long, this sort of spaghetti-like thing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: Schematic diagram of DNA replication, with a helicase unwinding DNA strand with DNA polymerases on the leading and lagging strand incorporating free nucleotides.

The process is the same, you basically have to break down the tissue, in this case it’s, let’s say, bone, so you have to demineralize it to release all of the biomolecules, and you have to degrade all the other stuff, but the DNA molecules are also degraded, so they’re already fragmented, so they’re very short, they’re very damaged, so they have modified nucleotides, and they also have contamination. So basically, your small fragments DNA is sitting in a super-modern DNA, so a lot of these things will be covered in more detail in other later sessions, but you have to remember that they’re damaged, they’re old, they’re very, very short.",

    "text": "1.5 DNA sequencing\nAnd this brings us on to DNA sequencing, which is essentially the conversion of the chemical, that’s better, chemical nucleotides of a DNA molecule to the human-readable ACTG on your computer screen, and what we basically do all of our analyses on in genetics and genomics. And the way this works is pretty common across most methods, which is you replicate a strand, as I described a minute ago, but instead of adding just a standard nucleotide, you add a fluorophore-modified nucleotide, so a fluorophore is a little molecule which essentially, when you excite it somehow, will emit a color.\nAnd in the case of DNA, you can have four different nucleotides, and each one will emit a different color Figure 1.5. And so quite often, the way you excite the fluorophore is firing a laser, which then emits the light, and you record the color. And so when you’re basically adding your nucleotide each time, you fire a laser, take a picture of the color being emitted, and then you know which base it is, and then you repeat on the next base, and next base, and next base.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: Molecular diagram of the four DNA nucleotides with coloured fluorophore amine groups. Source: (Ju et al. 2006)\n\n\n\n\nSanger sequencing\nSo historically, the first, let’s say, mass production sequencing method was called Sanger sequencing (Figure 1.6). So what this involved was taking a DNA molecule, making lots and lots of copies of it, but also fragmenting it in a random manner, so all of the, oh sorry, fragmenting it, no. I’m getting confused, one step ahead. Sorry, taking a DNA molecule, making lots of copies of it. Then you start extending the molecule, but instead of adding just no standard nucleotides, you mix in a few special modified nucleotides, which include essentially a blocker. And what this means is that once the polymerase gets to this particular blocking nucleotide, it will not extend it any further. However, as you added a mixture of standard nucleotides and also these blocker nucleotides, your DNA molecules will be extended to somewhat a random length each time, because you have many, many different copies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: Diagram of sanger sequencing, with a primer, template and free blocking nucleotides being added to ends of molecules at random lengths, and then being sent through a size-selecting capillary with a laser dector to identify which of the four blocking nucleotides are passing through the capillary and thus ready ina chromatopgraph.

And what would happen once you basically have your randomly extended molecules, but with these blockers, you would then send it through a capillary gel, which basically separates out the DNA molecules based on its length, and then you would fire a laser. And the important thing about these blocking nucleotides is also they were essentially fluorophores, so when you fire the laser, it’ll emit a light. And as you basically have your DNA molecules going through the capillary gel, so the shorter ones going faster through the gel because of resistance, and the longer ones going slower, you can basically record the order of the molecules going through the capillary gel. And then according to the light, you can basically see the different colors, and then with that, you can basically count which base is in your DNA molecule, as it goes through the capillary gel, and basically reconstruct the sequence by this method (Figure 1.7). However, this is, the approach was actually not so good for high-throughput DNA, so trying to reconstruct whole genomes, a lot of the original human genome was generated with this, but this tooyears, was extremely expensive, and it’s also very, very resource-hungry, you have to use a lot of preliminary, you have to use a lot of DNA, which again, when we deal with ancient DNA, which you get very small amounts, because it’s very degraded, it doesn’t really work.\n\n\nNext generation sequencing\nAnd then in about 2005, next-generation sequencing, which is a bit of a misnomer, to be honest, came along, where you can see sequence billions and billions of DNA molecules at once. It was very fast and cheap, and very much revolutionized genetics, and pushed us into a near of genomics. And the market leader was, and still is, is a company called Illumina. There are others called PacBio and IonTorrent, but really Illumina is the one that pretty much everybody uses nowadays for at least short read sequencing. And as I’m sure you’re all aware, this is sort of, these machines are more second generation now, we have new machines like Oxford Nanopore, which basically do very long reads, PacBio to a certain extent, and that’s sort of more a third generation that we’re entering right now.\nOh, poop. Oh, dear, so unfortunately, my pretty picture has been, a video has been deleted, but what I want you to imagine is a big black window with lots of colored points. And when I press play, on all of these points, they’re going to start changing colors, going from red to green to yellow to blue, and this happening thousands of times at once across this big black screen. And this is essentially the process of sequencing.",

    "section": "1.6 Illumina sequencing",
    "text": "1.6 Illumina sequencing\nSo what this black window that you should have been seeing would have been is something called a flow cell. This is a glass slide, and on this glass slide, it’s embedded sort of bound to the base of this, is lots of short DNA sequences, synthetic DNA sequences called oligos. And what you do is essentially take your DNA, and you basically inject it into the flow cell, and your DNA will spread across the flow cell, and start binding to this lawn. So imagine, literally imagine like a grass lawn on the base of this glass slide, and basically all of your DNA molecules are attaching to these random synthetic nucleotides, oligos.\n\nAdapters\nBut the question is, how is your DNA actually binding onto this lawn, and not basically getting washed away as your solution flows through the flow cell? What you do before injecting into the flow cell is convert your DNA samples into something called a library. A library is an adapters, and see these are basically the complement sequence of the oligos, of these synthetic oligos, which allow you to bind to the lawn flow cell. But in addition to the adapters, you add onto DNA sequence, things called priming sites, so this is where the enzymes actually bind on to start copying the DNA.\nAnd also, when you’re sequencing multiple samples at once on the same sequencing run, you can add things called indices, or known as barcodes, which are basically sample specific. So it allows you to mix multiple samples at once into one sequencing run, sequencing all at the same time, later on separate them out. So this is ultimately a slightly simplified version of a Illuminate DNA construct. So the X, X, X, X, X in the middle, this is your target. So this is actually your DNA sequence from your sample.\nAnd then at both ends, you essentially have a target primer. So this is where your polymerase will bind onto to start, then actually going, reading into your target, or your insert is another phrase that you can call it. Then prior to the target primer, you also have an index. So this is actually your sample specific barcode. This is actually added typically onto the adapter, and so this happens in the, no, sorry. And the library construction, sorry. And then also you have the adapter and index primer right at the beginning. So this is both what binds onto your flow cell, but also acts as a primer for actually reading the index because you also need a sequence index to know which DNA molecule, to which sample DNA molecule it’s coming from.\n\n\nClustering\nSo once you’ve done this, in Illuminate sequencing, you have the problem that the fluorophores will be adding to your DNA molecule. The eliterated is not enough for a camera to pick up. It’s much, much, much too small. You’re dealing with these very, very small biomolecules. And so what you have to do is once your DNA molecule is bound to your flow cell, sort of some randomly, you start to make lots and lots and lots of copies. So when you have lots of copies, that means that all the copies will make the same nucleotide, sorry, the same color at once, and make the emissions strong enough that a camera in the sequencer can actually take a picture and record a lot base it is.\nAnd the procedure making these copies is called clustering. So what this consists of is you have your DNA molecule, which is bound to one of the synthetic oligos on the lawn. And you basically do some of the bridge amplification where you basically bend over the DNA molecule. Sorry, sorry, I forgot. Your DNA molecule is single stranded at the moment. So when you bind this over, bend this over so that the reverse complement will bind to the other oligo, a primer can bind on and start reading across the molecule to reconstruct your double stranded DNA. So you basically get the complement or reverse strand of your DNA molecule to double stranded DNA. Then you had a primer to basically cut at one end or each end of the DNA molecule on the two different sort of forward and reverse adapters to result in two single stranded again DNA molecules. So basically the reverse complement of the DNA molecule, but you have one, sorry, two strands. Then you do the same thing again, bend it over, reconstruct the full double stranded molecule again, separate it out and do this many, many, many, many, many different times. And basically you have loads and loads and loads of copies of the same molecule in the same tiny little cluster, which is why you could go clustering in the same point in the flow cell.\nThen prior to sequencing, you actually will cut all of one of these types off. So let’s say you’d only be left with the purple ones to make sure you only have the same sequence. So not the reverse complements, but just the same sequence in one spot on your flow cell. Sorry, one second. Basically this onto the actual sequencing process.\n\n\nSequencing-by-synthesis\nLike I mentioned before with the Sanger sequencing and replication, what you do is you basically have your single stranded molecule, you’d had a prime, the primer, the priming site, sorry, priming site at the enzyme for the polymerase. And then you start to add free floating modified nucleotides, which have these fluorophores which will basically emit your light. So there is a slight difference in Sanger sequencing, however. So once you start adding, your polymerase goes along, it starts adding a free nucleotide and then you have the fluorophore. Now this fluorophore does block the next nucleotide being added on. So this makes sure that on all of the molecules in your cluster, and you’re only adding the correct nucleotide at one point. You then defy the laser, so the light is emitted, you take a photo.\nHowever, the difference here between Sanger sequencing and why actually Illumina sequencing or the sequencing by synthesis is much more resource-sufficient is you can actually cut off this fluorophore and then basically repeat the process again. So rather than basically having your DNA molecule having one use of single use, you can sort of recycle the same DNA molecule to basically then add the next nucleotide. So this case will be, let’s say this blue one, and I’ll attach that on. Fire a laser, take a photo, remove the fluorophore, and then back again. And basically you can reconstruct the entire sequence of the molecule without having to basically throw away the DNA molecule once you’ve taken the picture of just that single nucleotide. And this normally happens at the Illumina sequencing somewhere betweein either categories of 50, polyester and helicopter. Normally happens at 50, 75times. And these are also known as cycles.\nOkay, this is sort of what you should have been seeing like earlier in this animation. You should see a big black square with all these colored dots. So the black, black square is your flow cell and all these colored dots are these different clusters, each representing a single DNA molecule which we copy lots and lots and lots of times. And so what you can imagine sort of like in like a video or a film where basically you’ve got hundreds and hundreds of thousands of single shots just sped up over time, you add the first, so you have your flow cell, your DNA cluster is bound to the flow cell. You add the nucleotides, you fire the laser. And when you fire the laser, you should see basically a color being emitted. So in this case, green here and here, this is another DNA molecule, which is yellow, blue. And you take the picture and then you know that a green is only attached to teas. And so basically you see a tea molecule being picked up. So you record a tea, you remove the fluorophore, you add, wash those away, add the new fluorophores, the next base pair, the nucleotide will be bound onto the molecule, you fire the laser, it will be this time a blue. And this means you have a G. Then you again, cut the fluorophore off, add the new ones, fire the laser, emits a red. And so this is how you basically reconstruct all of these molecules. And again, the flow cell has millions and millions of these points, of these colored dots. And this is why you can see so many different DNA molecules all at once. Now, again, you have in your head these four colors before because you’ve seen the animation, also this picture, but there is differences to this. So there’s actually two different, with the luminous sequencing, there’s two different methods of actually emitting light. One is called the four channel system, or four color chemistry, where each nucleotide has a distinct color.\n\n\nColour chemistry\nBut there’s also on particularly the next seek and no seek machines, a slight different system, where they called, they tried to make it a bit cheaper by only using two colors or two dyes. And the approach they take there is that, again, a T is green, red is, C is a red. However, in this case, an A is actually two colors mixed at once. So if you emit that both, so if the machine picks up two colors, two wavelengths are being emitted, that is an A. However, if there was no color being emitted at all in that cluster, the machine reaches as a G, or a no detected dye. So this is very important for some caveats or things you have to consider when processing your data a bit later on.\n\n\nPaired-end sequencing\nSo something you have to consider though is we’re dealing with biology. It is not like, I don’t know, chemistry or even sort of physics, where things are perfect and wonderful. Over time, areas start happening, we’re not perfect. And essentially the imaging reagents start getting tired, the polymerases start adding mistakes, or don’t bind on properly and more areas will occur. So sometimes your nucleotides will not bind, meaning you’ll skip a base or you’ll get multiple nucleotides being added once and you go forward one. And essentially within your cluster, the DNA molecules being sort of replicated and emitting light will get desynced. So the color will get a bit blurry and less clear.\nAnd so first the machine does calculate some sort of base quality. So it captures the probability that it thinks it captured the right color, so the right nucleotide of each photo. But to the point where if it has no idea, it will call a dead base call, which will be reported as an N. And this became more and more of a problem, particularly in the early days of sequencing. And so people thought, how can we improve or correct such sort of errors? And the idea that came up was paired end sequencing.\nSo what this means is you do one sequencing in one direction, then you flip the entire read over and then read it from the other end. So whereas you have to consider that when you’re in the forward direction, over time you’re getting more and more errors. So the further you get into the molecule, the less confident you are. And so the more errors are gonna be. You can then turn it over and start the whole thing from scratch with fresh reagents. By going from the reverse end forward, you basically can correct the mistakes that were occurring at the end of the forward sequencing, but get the high quality calls from the other end from the beginning. So you can sort of, that’s a bad explanation. But you can sort of see here, you read it once in this direction. So you read the DNA insert and the prime, the index. You turn it over and you do the same thing, but from the beginning. So you basically sequence the same DNA molecule twice. An added bonus of this is also you get more cycles. So if your DNA molecule is a single molecule, it’s actually longer than the cycles. It’s 50% fair, five base pairs. By going from the other end, you can capture any DNA nucleotides which you’re missing from the forward sequencing. This is not so necessarily relevant to DNA. We will typically very short DNA molecules, but in some cases that will apply.\n\n\nDemultiplexing\nThen it comes on to biological to computational sequence. How do we take these sort of very raw nucleotide sequences and put it into a format that a computer can read? This typically happens in a step of demultiplexing. It’s actually very rare that you yourself as students will have to deal with this or do with this. Typically this is done by sequencing centers or by your lab team. But what this essentially consists of is normally or rather often nowadays, there is two steps in which you’re stuck together, which colloquially are no demultiplexing.\nThe first step is called base calling. This is where you basically take your photo files of every single nucleotide and convert this into an ACTNG. So taking image files, putting into a text file. But also in most cases, we have multiple sequence, multiple samples at once. And all the samples have these barcodes or indices. And we need to actually separate these out. So you know that all of these DNA molecules come from this sample or these DNA sample, sorry, DNA molecules from this sample. And this happens in this demultiplexing step. So essentially a computer program will read in each DNA molecule whether it finds such a barcode across from one sample, let’s say an example here, the red one that corresponds to sample one and the reverse here. And then the machine will basically sort or order the DNA molecules accordingly. So all of the DNA molecules which have these combinations and indices will put into sample one, sample two. So the blue and yellow will go here and so on. So this is something you, again, rarely will have to do yourself, but it’s something just to keep in mind.\n\n\nFASTQ File\nAnd the output of this demultiplexing step is something called a fastq file. So this is a text-based format for storing biological sequences itimes of cases nucleotide sequences, but also with the base quality scores. So these are the things where the computer tries to estimate the probability that it thinks that the nucleotide call was correct. And both are encoded basically with ASCII text characters. Doesn’t really matter what they are, if you’re not familiar with that. So this is a very, very small example. These files can be gigabytes in size, so huge, huge text files typically compressed, but still a gigabyte start to being compressed.\nBut what they, all they are made of, of basically a repeating set of four different lines. You have the first line up here, and this is called the ID line. This stores multiple information from the sequencer. So the sequencing, or the sequencing machine ID, then a run number, a flow cell ID, so each flow cell will have an ID from the manufacturer. And then you have essentially a bunch of coordinates going on here, which basically tells you from which cluster on their flow cell has the DNA molecule come from. Then you can have a bunch of extra information. This is often quite random depending on the sequencing and what they put in here, but often people put things like barcodes, maybe sort of how many errors were allowed during gene multiplexing, because you could do a certain enough filtering during that step. On the second line, you have the DNA sequence itself. So in this case, it starts with an N, this is dead-based call. This is actually quite often common, because this is when the camera is still calibrating itself. And so the first base is often a bit rubbish, but then the rest of the molecule, as you can see, sorry, the sequence here is A, C, T, and G, so it’s usually a new molecule. You’ll then have a plus, which is a separator. And the fourth line of this repeating set of four is then the base quality scores. So these are random, sort of a random set of characters, which I’ll explain in a second. But basically this tells you the confidence of that, how good we think that that nucleotide call was.\nAnd then you can basically see the same thing here on the next line, and it repeats as follows. So you can see, for example, this number is a bit different, because it’s from a slightly different coordinate cluster. So these quality scores, they are not uniform, I have to say. So it depends on both the age of the machine and what the manufacturer selected. But typically they will look something like this, where there’s a fixed order in the ASCII characters. And each one will correspond to a different probability of Fred’s score. I won’t explain exactly what that is, it’s a bit mazzy. But essentially what it means is that the higher the character along this score, the more confident you are of the base call, because the probability that it’s incorrect is sort of low.",

    "text": "1.7 Sequencing recap\nSo to recap, DNA molecules are essentially made of nucleotides, A, C, T, and Gs. We have two strands, which is complementary based pairings, C, G, CGI, AT, Atatoka, Star Wars, it’s great. Modern DNA is very long, but AT DNA is very short. And this is very good for NGS sequencing, where we do this massive multiplexing. So where rather than trying to sequence few very long DNA molecules, we sequence lots and lots and lots of very short ones at very high accuracy, which we can then reconstruct the long sequences later on, if you’ve got a good DNA. So the main steps are adding adapters to create something called a library, which allows your DNA molecules to bind to the glass slide, the flow cell, or something called a lawn. You then basically make a new strand, each cycle, you basically add a fluorescent nucleotide, which you can fire a laser, AT, which emits a colour, you can take a photo, and by basically recording, the order of the colours being emitted in a single point in the flow cell, you can reconstruct the DNA sequence. This de-syncing of clusters results in lower based quality scores over time, so you can also improve this by paired end sequencing, where you basically sequence from one end, and then do turn it around, then you sequence from the other end with fresh reagents.",

    "section": "1.8 Sequencing and considerations for ancient metagenomics",
    "text": "1.8 Sequencing and considerations for ancient metagenomics\nSo for the last section of this lecture, I want to give you a few ideas of things you should consider when you’re dealing with DNA for ancient genomics. Some of those are applicable to modern genomics too, but it’s things I find that, through my career, people forget about in some cases.\n\nLow DNA preservation\nSo firstly is low DNA preservation. So when you’re dealing with an ancient DNA, your samples are very old, and only have very little DNA in the sample, and during library preparation, you may have to do lots and lots and lots of amplification, make lots and lots and lots of copies of your DNA to make a sufficient amount to actually put sequencing. And this is important, and it will be discussed later during the week, but this is important because during library construction, you can actually inflate your counts in terms of DNA molecules that come from a particular taxon, micro-brothaxon, for example, and basically skew your estimate of which species are in your sample or not, or were in your sample because they’re now dead. Also, by overamplifying your DNA molecules, you reduce the number of sequencers you actually get out there. By having these duplicate molecules, you’re not actually providing any more extra information about your DNA library, and your sequencing flow cell only has a fixed number of sequencing slots, which basically, if you’ve overamplified your library, will basically fill up your slots and you will not sequence as many unique reads, and so the amount of information you’re getting out of your DNA molecule can be problematic. So this is actually quite, I’ve jumped ahead quite a bit in terms of detail here, but this is, I wanted to have the slides here for you to go back to and recap later.\n\n\nIndex hopping\nAnother thing during sequencing, you have to consider is something called index hopping. So this is a problem, particularly with Illumina Sequ, or people are aware of with Illumina sequencing, and it’s a challenge when you’re doing multiplex sequencing. When you’re sequencing lots and lots of samples at once, and you have to have these indexes or barcodes, which allow you to identify this DNA molecule comes from this sample. This seems to happen more often on a type of flow cell, which you find on Illumina HiSeq X and NovaSeq machines, and is ultimately caused by free floating index primers. And why that is a problem, is that if you do not sufficiently clean up your primers, during the clustering process, you can accidentally start adding on or switching barcodes between DNA molecules. This does happen at a relatively low rate, but it does happen. And so what it means is that essentially you switch the barcodes and you may accidentally assign a DNA molecule from one sample into another sample when you’re doing demultiplexing. And so let’s say you’re dealing with a microbiome sample, and you have lots of, let’s say, unless you have an oral microbiome sample and a gut microbiome sample, you may start seeing, for example, oral species popping up in your, or sort of oral species which are only found in the mouth, ending up in your gut samples, which may be a bit weird. This can also be a particular problem if you’re doing microbial genomics, so doing, let’s say, pathogen reconstruction, if you’re working on that. And you mix capture results with your shotgun samples because then you may start picking up the high amount of capture results in your shotgun samples where you’re doing screening. So you may start getting false positives there. There’s quite a few papers on this, also in the context of ancient DNA, so van der Waag has got quite a good paper to understand that and also had to correct such, or estimate the level of this in your studies.\n\n\nSequencing errors\nThey go back to the sequencing, you have to consider your sequencing errors. So if you don’t sufficiently quality control and check for these errors happening on DNA sequencing, you may actually start incorporating errors into your analysis downstream. So for example, what may happen is if you have a low base quality score, the machine may have picked up the wrong base or the wrong nucleotide. And this means that your DNA molecule or sequence, when you compare to reference genome databases or reference genomes, may start going to the wrong place or match the wrong reference genome because you have the wrong nucleotides, the wrong sequence. Which can be a problem. Also, it can reduce your chance of getting sufficient overlap during the assembly, which is where you basically stick together all of the overlapping DNA molecules together to try and reconstruct the entire molecule. This is something that Alex will present on Thursday, like Subna. And also if you’re doing variant calling for phylogenomics and you have very low coverage, this may also start increasing, increasing the add errors and you will do the wrong SNP call, which means that basically your, the relationship between your genomes in your tree, for example, will be skewed. And so it’s always very important to check for such errors and check that your sequencing run was high quality.\n\n\nDirty Genomes\nYou also have to consider, so this is again sort of jumping ahead, but there’s a reason why I’m putting in this presentation, is dirty genomes. So unfortunately, there are many reference genomes which are very dirty. So dirty, I mean, for example, having a lot of adapters still in there. And this means you have the problem where if you yourself have not sufficiently cleaned up your DNA library to remove the adapters and remove also pre-processing, you will start seeing weird results. For example, I very, very highly expect that if any of you screen against the NTPI-NT nucleotide database, you will start seeing carp everywhere. And the reason why is because people somehow got onto the NCBI a whole carp genome without removing any of their adapters. So there’s adapters sequences everywhere in the genome. And so whenever you have an adapter in your library, this will basically align to the carp genome and then you’ll get carp, which particularly if you’re trying to look at diet, for example, or ancient diet in, like say microbiome studies, where you look at some calculus, you may start seeing carp even if you’re, I don’t know, from, got samples from, I don’t know, Chile or somewhere where carp is not expected to find. You also often will find this with zebrafish. So often many, many, many, I think it’s Darius Varini or something like that, which makes no sense because all of these fish comes from one lake in Africa, but you see it everywhere in your metronome examples. And again, it’s because of dirty genomes where they think of adapters or vectors in the genome.\n\n\nLow Sequence Diversity\nAnother thing is low sequence diversity. So what I mean by this is mononucleotide reads, like GGGGG, or dinoucleotide repeats. This is not so much of an error necessarily when you’re doing metagenomics, but when you come into genomics, this can be a problem. So the problem with such DNA molecules, like this one here, GGGGG, is they’re very unspecific. They give you no information. That can come from any species everywhere because they are very common across all genomes. So the problem here is that firstly, it slows down your processing because basically you are aligning against, or comparing of DNA sequence against many, many, many different genomes to ultimately say, I don’t know which one it comes from, which is unnecessary. And also in some cases, it can inflate counts at higher nodes when you’re doing an LCA. This will be described later on. But this can be very common. So if you remember this two-color chemistry which I mentioned earlier, where you don’t have one color per base, but rather if there is no color emitted, the machine uses a G, particularly with an ek-seq and no-seq data, you will have a lot of these Gs, particularly as we’re dealing with ancient DNA, which is very short. When you have very short ancient DNA and you don’t reach all of your cycles, so let’s say you’re doinbase pair cycles, but your DNA molecules are onlbase pairs, you will basically get to the end of your DNA molecules and not add anything else. So you start getting these very long tails of Gs at the end of your molecules. And if you don’t remove these, this will make it very difficult to correctly align your DNA molecule to a reference genome or sequence. So be aware to look for these and remove these. Also because it will speed up your processing. So to recap the considerations, a lot of this will make more sense later on in the other sessions, but consider your duplication rates. You check for lots of copies of same DNA molecule in your library. It’s a good idea to check for index hopping, so making sure that the index combinations that you have in your library are correct and you’ve sorted your samples correctly. Always check for sequencing error and remove low quality bases if possible. Check for adapters, so to make sure you don’t start finding CARP everywhere. And also it’s a good idea to look for low-seq and diversity reads. For example, particularly if you put next-seq or no-seq data, because it just slows down your results and you get lower quality text-long assignment.\n\n\nQ and A\n\nHow to design barcodes\nOkay. How to design the barcodes. That’s a question from UD. That is quite tricky because there’s a lot of considerations you have to make when making sure there’s a balance and they’re not too similar to each other. Often manufacturers have tools which allow you to basically generate this. I believe they also to sentence and have standard sets which they can also send you that you request. So you yourself do not have to necessarily design these. It depends on your lab. So often I’d say speak to your sequencing center if you have them. Because they all have advice. All check manufacturers, I think most like Agilent and Illumina will also basically have such things for you then. Yeah, sometimes they make it a little bit defined but you can’t find them. And if you read the Meyer and Chercher article for buildinnew libraries, it would be provided in that set. Yeah. Could everyone hear Tina then? No? Okay. So she said that often the manufacturer make it a bit hard to find such functionality on their websites and stuff, but you can often do that. But also if you read the sort of classic paper by Meyer and Chercher 2011, 12, they actually have the set of barcodes that you can use yourself. So I think that link, that paper is on the website somewhere but we can also share with you.\n\n\nHow many indicies can you use\nHow many indices can you use? So this is a good question. This depends on your strategy and is slowly changing over time. So you can actually choose one index if you want, which is at the beginning of your, this is from Laura, which is the beginning of your molecule. What has been recommended and what the Meyer and Chercher paper introduces double indexing where you have two at the end. And these are attached to your adapters. What people are commonly doing now is actually adding additional barcodes called inline barcodes. So these are very short sequences, about seven base pairs I think, which you actually attach immediately to the DNA molecule before library preparation. So after extraction before library preparation. And this actually helps you with, sorry, with correcting for index hopping. So if you read the van der Waal paper, which I mentioned earlier, we can send the link again later. They also describe how they use these internal barcodes to separate out. So for example, you can get from a manufacturer about 100, let’s say barcodes, but you will normally per library can have somewhere between one to four separate identifiers.\n\n\nWhy Gs called more often in two colour chemistry sequencing\nSo I have a question regarding the gene calling for Gs, right? You mentioned that Gs are a characteristic of ancient DNA or sequencing errors. Why is it specifically Gs that are called more often rather than the other bases? The reason, okay, so that is because your DNA molecule is very short. So let’s say your DNA sequence is onlbase pairs long, but your sequencing cycles, so the number of cycles of imaging your machine is gonna do is let’s sabase pairs. Once you’ve got through thbase pairs, there is nothing to sequence anymore. Your lights are not going to emit anything. So when you’re on nobody-connected data, if no, sorry, machines, if no light is emitted, it reads it as a G. And you have to remember that the machine is not going to stop imaging once that one DNA molecule is finished. The DNA, the sequencing machine will keep taking photos until it’s reached to the number of cycles you’ve set, whether in this case, 75. So once you’ve exhausted your DNA molecule, there’s nothing to sequence, nothing to image anymore. So basically the machine will just keep picking up G for every remaining cycle of the run. Does that make sense? Yes. Yes, it does. But still I don’t get why G and not like AT. Why is it specifically the space? Because on nobody can make sick data, whatever reason they’ve decided Gs means nothing. There’s no color. Once it runs out of the…\nYeah, so basically the problem with ancient DNA is we often have very short reads. So you might do say two bsequencing, which is very common, but you might have a read that’s onlbases long. And so once it kind of runs out of DNA, it will just, it won’t sequence anymore. So there’ll be no more fluorophores. And because the NovaSeq and the next you can interpret that as a G, you’ll just get these polyG tails, but actually it just means no more data. And another thing to… Could you make it up for yourself? And I think this may also happen in modern data as well. If you’ve fragmented your modern data too short, you’ll also get that. It’s just that in the complex of ancient DNA, the reason why I said that is because we are naturally already very, very short because of the degradation. And I’ll also say this is, if you’re used to doing modern DNA, this is where it’s really different because let’s say you’re sequencing a regular library. What you would normally do for modern DNA is you have genomic DNA, which is huge. So for your microbial DNA, each genome is something likmillion bases long, and that’s way too big for an aluminum machine. So what you would do is you would shear it either enzymatically or by sonication, usually to an average size of aboubases. And then you do your alumina sequencing usually two by 150. So you kind of measure one side, then you measure the other side, and you get a total obases sequenced out of thbase pair read. You never run out of DNA. You never actually get to the end of the molecule when you’re sequencing. And so for most people that do modern DNA sequencing, they’ve never dealt with this problem before because they never see it because they’re always sequencing a DNA molecule longer than what their sequencing chemistry can actually do. For ancient DNA, it’s very different. We actually don’t shear. We take advantage of the fact that because our DNA is short, we don’t have to shear. And because we don’t shear, it actually allows us to exclude some of the modern contamination because any modern DNA that’s in there will be so long that it won’t build a proper library and it won’t be sequenced. And so it kind of helps us clear out some of the modern DNA that might be present. And so we will only sequence the short DNA sequences, which are more likely to actually be ancient. But the problem there is we’re dealing with the real size of the ancient DNA, which might bbases, 30 basesbasesbases. We don’t have necessarily the kind of consistency you would have if you were intentionally shearing modern DNA. So we do have some sequences that are very short.\n\n\nWhat is full genome seuqencing\nOkay, so Liasat asked, when we’re talking about whole genome sequencing, so WGS and full genome sequencing, FGS, is it the same? I’ve never heard of FGS. So yes, I would say it probably is.\n\n\nTools for generating indicies\nAnd then Jaime asks, is, I hope I’m saying that right. Is this kind of program publicly available? Is this to? Sorry? It was the index checker to make sure your pool is not. It was the index checker, yes. So again, lots of tools online, I think, basically, to make sure there’s no overlap. Normally the manufacturer will offer such thing.",

    "text": "4.1 Introduction\nMicrobial species come from diverse groups of organisms but are generally defined as organisms which are not visible to the naked eye. The most prominent amongst them are bacteria, which are single-celled prokaryotes with either circular and linear dsDNA genomes (up to ~14 Mbp). Archaea are mostly mutualistic or commensal single-celled prokaryotes with circular dsDNA genomes (~0.5 to ~5.8 Mbp). The often references group of protozoa, is a not phylogenetically defined grouping (often used in databases). They are a wide variety of free-feeding single-celled eukaryotes from the protists group with larger genomes (~2.9 to ~160 Mbp).\nFinally, viruses are understood as microbial organisms, even though they are not technically considered as “organisms”. Viruses lack the ability to live or replicate independently of host cells. They are mostly defined as infectious agents and have smaller linear or circular ssDNA, dsDNA & RNA genomes (2 kb to over 1 Mb). Another category of viruses are retroviruses. These will always be RNA viruses which can integrate into the host genome by converting to DNA. But there are also DNA viruses, which integrate into the human genome. There the virus can either be latent and be later triggered to activate, continuously produce virions or lose the ability to produce virions and become part of the host genome. An integrated genome is called a provirus and vertically inherited proviral sequences are called endogenous viral elements (EVEs).\nThere are several types of microbial organisms found within ancient DNA samples of animal hosts:\nHowever, it should be noted that not all cases are quite as clear-cut, as there are wide varieties of microbial lifestyles. Some organisms can be considered pathogenic in one sampling location and commensal in the next (pathobionts). Some organisms can also be considered harmful, when they are represented in very large amounts or in combination with other organisms. The sampling location can therefore be important information when studying the health of hosts.",

    "text": "4.2 Larger Genomic Elements\nWhen using reference sequences from public depositories, such as NCBI, you will often be confronted with multiple sequences which represent the chromosome(s) and additional extrachromosomal sequences associated with a species or strain. A chromosome is understood as the main genetic element. It contains the core genome with all essential genetic elements, which usually remain the same across a species.\nPlasmids, on the other hand, are extra-chromosomal DNA replicons. They are replicating and acquiring/losing genetic material independently of the chromosome and can be present in high copy numbers. Plasmids can be vertically or horizontally transferred. The number of plasmids of a bacterium varies a lot (0 to 30+), and can vary within a species. They can carry virulence genes and genes which can give selective advantages. Plasmids generally have much smaller circular genomes (1 to over 400 Kbp). It should be noted that they are under-represented in databases, meaning that they are often ignored during the assembly/sequencing process and thus not present in all reference sequences, even if they could otherwise have been there.\nBesides plasmids, bacteriophages (or phages) are also important extrachromosomal (and sometimes chromosomally integrated) genetic material associated with bacterial genomes. Although they are not considered as part of the genome, and therefore part of reference sequences, if they are not integrated in the host cell genome. Bacteriophages are dsDNA viruses of small size that infect bacteria. As phages have mostly dsDNA genomes, they are also well suited for the recovery using standard aDNA techniques. They can be found everywhere and carry gene sets of diverse size and composition. They enter the cytoplasm of bacteria, where they can then replicate. There are a huge number of phages, and some are specific to certain bacterial genera or species, which can be useful for identifying taxa or phylogenetic clades. When bacteriophage genomes integrate into the host cell chromosomal genome (e.g. through horizontal gene transfer) or exist as a plasmid within the bacterial cell, they are called prophages. They can make up a large fraction of the pan-genome of plastic species.",

    "section": "4.3 Sampling & Sequencing",
    "text": "4.3 Sampling & Sequencing\nFor ancient DNA samples, screening for organisms of interest is usually performed on “shotgun” sequencing data, which can then be either further genomically analysed following species identification or the library will be enriched for organisms identified during screening. Prior to sequencing, laboratory workflows, and particularly library building setups, can have a major impact on your final output (e.g. if you are interested in RNA/ssDNA viruses but have dsDNA libraries).\nEach pathogen is subject to tissue tropism, meaning that each species will have a range of cells or tissue types it will preferentially or exclusively proliferate and replicate in. This phenomenon is called tissue tropism. In some instances, the pathogen can also become latent within said tissues, meaning it will remain within the host tissue without causing disease (but could still reactivate later). Organisms which cause bacteremia or viremia, meaning they are present in the bloodstream, will not be as restricted and are generally considered easier to detect. Although this can be limited by the disease phenotype or the stage of infection (e.g. Haemophilus influenzae).\nAccordingly, what organism you can find in your data is highly dependent on the sample and where it was taken from. For example, if the organism of interest enters the bloodstream, teeth, which are vascularised and are excellent DNA archives, will probably be a good choice for sampling. Some pathogens (e.g. Mycobacterium leprae) are present in higher quantities within lesions caused by their infections, making those lesions better suited for sampling. In the case of infections, which are unlikely to be retrievable from hard tissue, calcified nodules can be an interesting type of sample. Bone will generally be less well suited, with some exceptions. Integrated viruses and retroviruses will be likelier to be found in samples types with higher host DNA, such as the petrous bone or the ossicles. And early childhood infection can also be found within low remodelling cortical bone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome Myths to Dispel…\n\n\n\n\nMicrobial content and pathogen content is NOT directly correlated to human DNA content. Human DNA content is not a measure for overall sample preservation. You can have really bad samples for human DNA but get a full microbial genome from the same sample!\nYou can also find microbial signatures in petrous bones etc. it will just be a different range of organisms. Everything is worth getting screened!\n\n\n\nThe typical number of sequences recovered for an organism will depend on a range of factors which can only rarely be predicted, even in samples for which osteological/historical records show a clear association with a pathogen. Major factors are: overall sample preservation, depth of sequencing, abundance of the organism peri-mortem, disease phenotype, genome size & composition, “noise” from other organism, etc.\nOverall, it is considered a good result if your target organism makes out around 0.1% of shotgun datasets, but in many cases it will be way less. However, depending on the organism, the amount of data you need to confidently classify it will be very different, mostly due to sequence conservation, genome size and complexity. While a bacterium is generally easier to detect, their large genome size and sequence conservation, can make them harder to verify. On the other hand, viruses, having much smaller genomes, are harder to detect, especially at low sequencing depth, but generally easier to verify within a margin of uncertainty.\nFor some applications in microbial genomics, unselective/unbiased sequencing is key, and because of this shotgun sequencing is a powerful tool at our disposal, since it allows for the indiscriminate sequencing of all DNA found within the sample. Particularly in cases of organisms with large pangenomes, where you might be interested in looking for a large variety of intervals, which would be very costly to do using target enrichment. Or in cases where novel insights and genomes become relevant following the design of a target enrichment kit. Additionally, it allows for the simultaneous analysis of both microbial and host DNA. Understanding the composition of the microbial community of your sample can also be highly relevant with regard to identifying co-infectants, reconstructing disease histories and excluding gene intervals which could also stem from commensals or contaminants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShotgun sequencing for microbial genomics\n\n\n\nPro(s):\n\nNon-targeted taxa can be found.\nAllows the analysis of DNA from both microbial organisms and host simultaneously.\nAllows you to detect untargeted co-infections.\nAllows you to understand the composition of the microbial community (can be relevant for genomic analysis).\nNo knowledge of the taxon genomic diversity is needed beforehand.\nEnables the long time use of the data with ever-growing databases.\n\nCon(s):\n\nCan be much more expensive (depending on the sample).\nOverall less effective at generating adequate/high coverage data.\n\n\n\nHowever, microbial species make up only very small fractions of genomic libraries. So small that it can either be impossible or very expensive to try to assemble a genome using only shotgun data in most circumstances. This is usually where target enrichment, or capture, comes into play. Often, the baits required for capture are custom designed for each study. The design of such kits necessities appropriate knowledge of the genetic diversity to be expected during analysis. In most cases, a mixture of shotgun and target enrichment can be most effective, especially with regard to authentication if enrichment is performed on UDG/Half-UDG genomic libraries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTarget enrichment for microbial genomics\n\n\n\nPro(s):\n\nMuch cheaper per genome, especially in samples with bad preservation.\nEffective at generating high coverage genomes.\nAllows for the generation of large number of genomes effectively.\nGreat for core-genome reconstructions.\n\nCon(s):\n\nNecessitates knowledge of the genetic diversity relevant to your research questions during the design phase.\nAny sequence not included, within a margin of variation, will not be captured.\nWill not generate any data with regard to the host or the rest of the microbial community (in fact, that is the point).\nFor some species, capturing the pangenome would be extremely expensive, provided it doesn’t fully exceed kit sizes.",

    "text": "4.4 Validating the Presence of Organisms of Interest\nFollowing analysis of your data using appropriate databases and taxonomic classifiers, it is time to validate your hit. The results of a classifier should not be your end result. Properly validating the presence of a species is key to any genomic analysis! An identification using taxonomic classifiers is not a sufficient validation on its own, as it can be very tricky to work around false-positive hits and missing database entries. Databases are biased towards pathogenic species, as they represent the bulk of research. Closely related non-pathogenic species will either be represented less or not at all, which leads to high read assignments to the LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor) and pathogenic taxa. You should also consider whether it makes biological sense for the species you found to be detected in the sampled tissue and based on your laboratory workflow.\nFor ancient DNA, the taxon validation will often consist of three steps:\n\nAuthentication of the data as aDNA using deamination signatures and fragment lengths.\nComparative or competitive mappings to relevant reference sequences (target organism and closely related pathogenic/environmental/commensal species).\nIdentification of intervals specific to the target species or sub-species.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIt can also be a good idea in some cases to double-check the modern data you are using during your analysis. There are cases in which the metadata doesn’t match reality.\n\n\nIncreased coverage in selected intervals in an alignment is often caused by sequence conservation. Meaning that you could have the same number of reads mapping to a genome but in the first case all reads are mapping to 5% of the genome with high depth of coverage, whether in the second one you will see low coverage across the whole sequence. The first one is likely to be a false positive, as your detection is probably based on intervals from either a commensal or an environmental organism which have very high sequence similarity to your reference genome. This can be further worsened by low complexity intervals. These peaks will usually also be reflected in the edit distance, as such tiling will also result in more sequence mismatches. While this can be reduced with higher mapping stringency, this in turn will probably decrease your coverage significantly and in some cases this can cause a reference bias. However, in most cases, these intervals will not pass the mapping quality filter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition\n\n\n\nConserved Intervals: Regions of genomes common to organisms from the same taxonomic units (can affect all taxonomic ranks and child taxa, and very distantly related organisms). They will show high sequence similarity and cause noise/contamination within the analysis, particularly for ancient DNA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn many cases, running a range of comparative and/or competitive mappings to closely related species is advised in order to exclude a misidentification and the presence of multiple species with similar sets of genes in your dataset (e.g. Neisseria meningitidis). It can also be useful to use multiple reference sequences per species if it has multiple phylogenetically strongly delimited clades (e.g. H. influenzae)\n\n\nViruses are less affected, as they do not carry house-keeping genes, and only have a very small usually highly specialised set of genes, which makes them easier to validate. However, viral sequencing of non-pathogenic species has only recently started to become more popular due to metagenomic studies, i.e. non-pathogenic taxa are even more under-represented, and many viral genomes have low complexity repeats over large portions of their sequence. Additionally, some viruses are highly divergent within the same species.\nFinally, intervals or mutations specific to the target organism should be identified and investigated. This can range from plasmids, genes, and phages to specific mutations. Often a combination of these factors is required to confidently validate the presence of the organism. This step should not be overlooked as this will not always be clearly visible in a phylogeny, depending on the composition of the alignment used.",

    "section": "4.5 Genomes",
    "text": "4.5 Genomes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrains VS Genomes\n\n\n\n\nA strain is a genetic variant or subtype of a species or sub-species. They usually exhibit significant genetic differences to other strains of the same taxonomic unit. The level of change required for significance can vary.\nA genome can be the exact copy of an already sequenced strain.\n\nThe case of aDNA: Since our samples are so old, most of our genome constitute new strains. However, caution is advised. Particularly with clonal species (e.g. Black Death genomes).\n\n\nThere are many different microbial species, and they all have very different evolutionary dynamics and genomes. This means that depending on which species you are working on, you might have to approach genomic analysis differently. Additionally, the research questions which could be answered with your data will/can also be rather different. This section will summarise some of the core principles underlying many possible research questions.\nMapping is an important tool in ancient DNA to investigate the presence and absence of genomic intervals. However, mapping can be impeded by the reference sequence itself. Gene duplication, low complexity sequences and GC Skew (over- or under-abundance of GC in intervals) can impact the mappability (and mapping evenness) of sequencing reads to the reference sequence and their mapping quality score. Which in turn might be problematic during analysis. This can be expressed in mappability estimates, which estimate how likely it is for short reads to map to a sequence interval based on its composition and uniqueness.\nApplying a mapping quality filter by default after a bwa aln mapping, will not only cause all bad quality reads to be removed from the alignment, but also any read which could align to multiple sections of your reference genome. This means that most likely every duplicated interval/gene, specific or conserved, and low complexity regions will also be removed! Mapping quality filters are important tools, but you should make sure you understand how much of the genome is actually covered (e.g. terminal repeats in viral genomes) and when to apply them. The same applies for competitive mappings using bwa aln!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition\n\n\n\nSequence Complexity: Defined as the observed vocabulary usage for word size. Meaning, how complex is the sequence of nucleotides within an interval. Often given as values calculated using either entropy or DUST algorithms. E.g.:\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA &gt;&gt; LOWEST COMPLEXITY\nATGATGATGATGATGATGATG &gt;&gt; LOW COMPLEXITY\nATGTTTCGAGGCATGATAACCGTATG &gt;&gt; COMPLEX SEQUENCE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition\n\n\n\nGC Content: Is usually given as a percentage of guanine and cytosine bases within the sequence. Can impact DNA stability, amplification, sequencing, and capture if the GC content is too high or too low. Too high or too low GC-content will also lead to a loss in sequence complexity. E.g.:\nGCCCCCCCGGAATGGACCCGCGCCT &gt;&gt; 80% GC\nATTTTGAACCTAATTTATATAGCAA &gt;&gt; 20% GC\n\n\n\n4.5.1 Recombination\nBacteria and viruses are haploid and have small genomes, making some things much easier, but… They like to mix and match! Microbial organisms will exchange genetic material using a range of biological mechanisms (conjugation, transduction, and/or transformation) this leads to increased genetic diversity via horizontal gene transfer. Some parts of the genome will be more heavily affected by this exchange than others. This constant exchange of genetic material can happen while maintaining genome size, meaning that while genes are gained, others are lost. How much recombination a genome will undergo, is highly dependent on the species or sometimes the phylogenetic clade. These dynamics cause recombination breakpoints in reference based alignments where SNP counts will increase, which can impede phylogenetic analysis (e.g.: by causing elongated branches).\nHowever, some species do not recombine at all or do so only very rarely. These species have clonal genomes, meaning they transfer their entire genome vertically, most the of time, without significant changes to their pangenome or the sequence itself. Actually, many of the species which have been extensively studied using aDNA, fall within this group (e.g. Y. pestis, M. leprae).\nMost microbial organisms change their genomes via recombination and gene loss/gain, while maintaining genome size and retaining their core genome. Virulence is then often defined by gaining or losing virulence factors. However, some increase their virulence by reducing their genome and becoming highly specialised (e.g. Borrelia recurrentis) in what is called reductive evolution. In these cases, it is of interest to include closely related phylogenetically “basal” species (pathogenic or not), which might inform you on genes/plasmids the modern strains have lost, but the ancestral genomes might still have retained.\n\n\n4.5.2 Pangenomes\nAs mentioned, microbial organisms can be very plastic and exchange genomic material. This can lead to a wide variety of genes being represented within a single species. Pangenomes represent the sum of all genomic intervals represented within the genomes of one species. And thus, characterising the genome of a new strain can be a lot more complex than sticking to a single reference sequence.\nPangenomes are made up of three groups:\n\nCore Genes: a set of essential genes common to all strains of a species.\nAccessory/Shell Genes: a set of genes common amongst some strains of a species which encode for supplementary or modified biochemical functions. In some cases these will also be virulence genes.\nSingleton/Unique/Cloud Genes: genes, which are specific to single strains of a species. Unlikely to be recovered and identified using ancient DNA.\n\nWe also differentiate between open and closed pangenomes. In open pangenomes, the gene set available to the bacterium constantly expands by acquisition and loss of genes via horizontal gene transfer from its environment, for the purpose of adaptation (e.g. environmental adaptation, metabolism, virulence and antibiotic resistance). All while maintaining genome size and vertical transmission of the core genome. Closed pangenome have limited exchanges of genetic material. This is often the case in highly specialised organisms. So while they are much more plastic than strictly clonal species, the available genetic pool for exchange will be smaller.\n\n\n4.5.3 SNP Effects\nSingle nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can heavily impact the function of genes and the phenotype of an organism when they happen to affect and change the amino acid sequence of coding elements of a genome. This effect is frequently used in ancient DNA to predict the presence/absence of significant mutation, which could have changed the phenotype of a disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinitions\n\n\n\nNon-synonymous (missense) mutation: SNPs that alters the amino acid sequence of a protein by changing one base of a triplet group. E.g.: GAT&gt;GGT == Asp(D)&gt;Gly(G)\nFrameshift: Changes in the amino acid sequence caused by insertions or deletions of nucleotides in coding sequences which are not multiples of three.\nStart/Stop Codon: Nucleotide triplet which signals the beginning and end of translation.\nStop/Start-gain mutation: Mutation which leads to a change in the amino acid sequence and leads to a premature stop/start of translation.\nStart/Stop-loss mutation: Mutation which leads to a change in the amino acid sequence and leads to the loss of a start/stop codon. Leads to the reduction or elimination of protein production.\n\n\nThe impact of such changes is predicted by tracking changes in the translation of coding sequences using an annotated reference sequence and SNP/MNP/Indel calls. The problem when using ancient DNA, is that genome coverage is often uneven, and it isn’t rare to lack full coverage of intervals of interest or lack resolution to correctly call indels across the reference. Larger genomic insertions and recombination are also not accounted for when a genome is reconstructed solely using a reference based approach. This means that while SNP effects can indeed be very interesting and potentially highly significant, they should be understood as prediction based on the available coverage. It is therefore important to report coverage over the entire coding and promoter intervals, when discussing SNP effect, and consider potential issues.\nImportant exception are known and heavily conserved mutations, which for example are involved in pseudogenisation. Pseudogenisation is the process through which genes lose their function due to mutations but remain in the genome without being expressed or without having a function. It is a mechanism underlying gene loss. They are significant in aDNA research because we can capture “active” versions of pseudogenes and potentially date their loss of function. It is a critical part of the genome reduction process of highly specialised bacteria.\n\n\n4.5.4 Virulence Associated Intervals\nOne of the questions ancient DNA research is interested in is the evolution of virulence in pathogenic species. The location and nature of virulence factors can vary. An increase in virulence can be caused by gene gain (on chromosomes or plasmids), plasmids, mutations, or changes to complex gene mechanisms (e.g. immune evasion). To understand the underlying processes of virulence adaptation has been one of the recurring questions in the field. Virulence intervals vary, but can be found within the literature and in some cases in curated databases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nAre there loci associated with increased virulence known to the literature?\nAre there phylogenetic groups associated with increased virulence?\n\n\n\nNot all species have evolutionary dynamics which allow us to detect a temporal signal or recognise geographic structure within their phylogenies. However, phylogenetic clades can also inform us on other aspects of their evolution (virulence, ecological niche etc.). When investigating virulence, you should be checking for the presence of chromosomal virulence factors (genes, mutations). Currently, this is mostly done using either as a Presence/Absence matrix or a cluster analysis. As well as investigating the presence/absence of plasmids and plasmid mediated virulence factors and functional mechanisms, and relevant SNPs.\nBeyond virulence, some genes, and gene combinations can also inform us on changes in disease phenotype and microbial adaptation to the host or the taxon’s ecological niche.",

    "text": "6.5 Understanding the command prompt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: An example command prompt\n\n\n\nAfter opening the terminal what you will normally see is a blank screen with a ‘command prompt’, like the one shown above. This typically consists of your username, the device name, a colon, a directory path and ends with a dollar symbol. Like so:\n#| eval: false\n&lt;username&gt;@&lt;device_name&gt;:~$\nThe command prompt is never involved in any command, it is just there to ensure you know who and where you are. When copying a command you should NOT copy the command prompt.\nOften times, when looking for commands online, the commands ran will pe prefaced with a $. This is a stand-in for the command prompt. When adding multi-line commands, it is also common to preface the additional lines with a &gt;. When copying such commands it is therefore important to remove these characters from the start of each line (if present).\nFinally, in this tutorial, the symbols&lt;&gt; are used to show things that will/should be replaced by another value. For example, in Thiseas’ command prompt &lt;username&gt; will be replaced by lamnidis, as that is his username.\nNow back to your prompt: It tells you that you are in the directory ~. The directory ~, stands for your home directory. Note that this shorthand will point to a different place, depending on the machine and the user.\nIf you want to know what the shorthand means, (here comes your first command!) you can type in pwd, which stands for “print working directory”. Your “working directory” is whichever directory you are currently in.\n#| eval: false\npwd\n/home/&lt;YOUR_USERNAME&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIn programming documentation, it is very common to use &lt;ALL_CAPS&gt; notation to indicate something that doesn’t exist, or will vary depending on the user.\nWhenever you see such a notation (i.e., triangular brackets and all caps), you must always replace that whole section (including the &lt;&gt;) with whatever is on your system! You should never copy and paste this blindly!\n\n\nThis prints the entire “filepath” of the directory i.e. the route from the “root” (the deepest directory of the machine), through every subdirectory, leading to your particular working directory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you’re not in your home directory (i.e., the output isn’t exactly the same as the output above), please run the command\n#| eval: false\ncd $HOME\nYou’ll learn about this commands in a bit!",

    "text": "6.6 Absolute vs Relative paths\nFilepaths (a.k.a. “paths”), come in two flavours. Let’s talk a bit about them!\n\nAn absolute path will start with the deepest directory in the machine shown as a /. Paths starting with ~ are also absolute paths, since ~ translates to an absolute path of your specific home directory. That is the directory path you see in the output of the pwd command you just ran.\nAlternatively a relative path always begins from your working directory (i.e. your current directory). Often this type of path will begin with one (./) or two (../) dots followed by a forward slash, but not always. In the syntax of relative pathways . means “the current directory” and .. means “the parent directory” (or the ‘one above’).\n\n\n6.6.1 A real life analogy for paths\nYou have just arrived to Leipzig for a summer school that is taking place at MPI-EVA. After some questionable navigation, you find yourself at the Bayerische Bahnhof. Tired and disheartened, you decide to ask for help.\nYou see a friendly-looking metalhead (Figure 6.2), and decide to ask them for directions!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: A friendly-looking metalhead.\n\n\n\n\nI’m Happy to help, but I only give directions in absolute paths!\nFrom Leipzig Main Station, you should take Querstraße southward.\nContinue straight and take Nürnberger Str. southward until you reach Str. des 18 Oktober.\nFinally take Str. des 18 Oktober. moving southeast until you reach MPI-EVA!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolute paths\n\n\n\nThe directions above are equivalent to an absolute path, because they will ALWAYS take you to MPI-EVA, but you can only apply these directions if you start from Leipzig Main Station!\nExamples of absolute paths:\n/home/&lt;PATH&gt;/&lt;TO&gt;/\n/Leipzig_Main_Station/Querstraße/Nürnberger_Str/Str_18_Oktober/Deutscher_Platz/MPI-EVA\n\n\nNot sure how to get back to Leipzig Main Station to apply those directions, you decide to ask someone else for directions…\nLucky for you, a friendly looking local is passing by (Figure 6.3)!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: A friendly-looking local.\n\n\n\n\nYou’re currently on Str. des 18 Oktober. Walk straight that way, past the tram tracks, and you will find Deutscher Platz. You will see MPI-EVA to your right!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelative paths\n\n\n\nThese directions are equivalent to a relative path! They are easy to follow, but only work when you happen to start at the position you were in when you first got the directions!\nExamples of relative paths:\n./&lt;PATH&gt;/&lt;TO&gt;/my_file.txt\n../Str_18_Oktober/Deutscher_Platz/MPI-EVA",

    "section": "6.8 Datastreams, piping, and redirects",
    "text": "6.8 Datastreams, piping, and redirects\nEach of the commands you learned above is a small program with a very specialised functionality. Programs come in many forms and can be written in various programming languages, but most of them share some features. Specifically, most programs take some data in and spit some data out! Here’s how that works, conceptually:\n\n6.8.1 Datastreams\nComputer programs can take in and spit out data from different streams (Figure 6.4). By default there are 3 such data streams.\n\nstdin : the standard input\nstdout: the standard output\nstderr: the standard error\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.4: Diagram showing stdin going into the program, and two output streams from the program: stderr and stdout.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPro Tip\n\n\n\nEach programme also has an ‘exit code’, which can tell you if execution completed with/without errors. You will rarely see these in the wild.\n\n\nTypically, the stdin is where the input data comes in.\nThe stdout is the actual output of the command. In some cases this gets printed to the screen, but most often this is the information that needs to be saved in an output file.\nThe stderr is the datastream where errors and warnings go. This gets printed to your terminal to let you know when something is not going according to plan (Figure 6.5)!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.5: This program (in the form of a bash script executed in the terminal) takes no input, and prints one line to the stdout and one line to the stderr.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.8.2 Piping\nA “pipe” (|) is a really useful feature of bash that lets you chain together multiple commands! When two commands are chained together with a pipe, the stdout of the first command becomes the stdin of the second (Figure 6.6)! The stderr is still printed on your screen, so you can always know when things fail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.6: Diagram showing stdin going into the program, and two output streams from the program: stderr and stdout, with the stdout becoming the stdin of a second program.\n\n\n\nExample:\n#| eval: false\nhead -n 10 Boosted-BBB-meta.tsv | tail -n1\nnetsukeJapan    C       Artwork\nThe above command will only show the 10th line of Boosted-BBB-meta.tsv. The way it works is that head will take the first 10 lines of the file. These lines are then passed on to tail which will keep only the last of those lines.\n\n\n6.8.3 Redirects\nMuch like streams of water in the real world, datastreams can be redirected.\nThis way you can save the stdout of a program (or even the stderr) into a file for later!\n\nstdin can be redirected with &lt;.\n\nAn arrow pointing TO your program name!\n\nstdout can be redirected with &gt;.\n\nAn arrow pointing AWAY your program name!\n\nstderr can be redirected with 2&gt;.\n\nBecause it is the secondary output stream.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPro Tip\n\n\n\nIt is also possible to combine streams, but we won’t get into that here.\n\n\nExample:\n#| eval: false\nhead -n 10 Boosted-BBB-meta.tsv | tail -n1 &gt; line10.txt\nThis will create a new file called line10.txt within your work directory. Using cat on this file will BLOW YOUR MIND - (GONE WRONG)!\n\n(Don’t forget to like and subscribe!)\n\n#| eval: false\ncat line10.txt\nnetsukeJapan    C       Artwork\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.7: Here you can see an example of redirecting the output of the datastreams_demo.sh program from before. Redirecting the stdout with &gt; only prints the stderr to the screen, and saves the stdout into output.txt. Additionally, we can redirect the stderr with 2&gt; into runtime.log, and then nothing is printed onto the screen.",

    "text": "6.10 Variables\nVariables are a central concept of all programming. In short, a variable is a named container whose contents you can expand at will or change.\nYou can assign variables (tell the computer what do you want it to contain) with = and pull their contents with $\nThe easiest way to see the contents of a variable is using echo!\n#| eval: false\necho \"This is my home directory: $HOME\"\nThis is my home directory: /home/ubuntu\n$HOME is a variable of the type called environment variables, which are set the moment you open your terminal or log into a server, they ensure the system works as intended and should not be change unless you are very sure of why.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment Variables\n\n\n\nEnvironment variables in bash are typically named in all capital letters. It is a good idea to avoid using only capital letters for your variable names, so you avoid accidentally overwriting any environment variables.\n\n\nBut as mentioned, you can store in a variable anything you want, so let’s see a few examples:\nFirst let’s try to store a number:\n#| eval: false\nGreekFood=4            #Here, 'GreekFood' is a number.\necho \"Greek food is $GreekFood people who want to know what heaven tastes like.\"\nGreek food is 4 people who want to know what heaven tastes like.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe # is used to add comments to your code. Comments are annotations that you write in your code to understand what it is doing but that the computer does not run. Very useful for when your future self or another person looks at your code\n\n\nNow let’s store a word (“string”):\n#| eval: false\nGreekFood=delicious   #We overwrite that number with a word (i.e. a 'string').\necho \"Everyone says that Greek food is $GreekFood.\"\nEveryone says that Greek food is delicious.\nYou can also store more than a single word (that is still a “string”):\n#| eval: false\nGreekFood=\"Greek wine\" #We can overwrite 'GreekFood' again, \n## but when there is a space in our string, we need quotations.\necho \"The only thing better than Greek food is $GreekFood!\"\nThe only thing better than Greek food is Greek wine!\nSince variables can be reset to whatever you want, you can also store a number again:\n#| eval: false\nGreekFood=7 #And, of course, we can overwrite with a number again too.\necho \"I have been to Greece $GreekFood times already this year, for the food and wine!\"\nI have been to Greece 7 times already this year, for the food and wine!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverwriting variables\n\n\n\nIn these examples you have seen how the same variable has been overwritten, this means that you can only access the last content that you stored in the variable. All the previous contents that a variable may have had are inaccessible as soon as the same variable is given a new value.",

We have assigned Banana to the variable $Arr. As mentioned above, when single (') quotes are used the computer just prints what it receives without caring that $Arr is a variable.\nIn the echo with the double (\") quotes we are telling the computer to extract the value from the variable $Arr and that is why we see the store value (Banana) in the printed output in the terminal.",

But, what about when you need to repeat a command multiple times on a list of things, for example a list of files?\nTo repeat an action (command) for a set of things (list, e.g. files) one needs to employ the concept of a loop. One of the most commonly used loops, is the for loop.\nA for loop allows us to go through a list of things and perform some actions. Let’s see an example:\n#| eval: false\nVariable=Yes\nfor i in Greece Spain Britain; do\n  echo \"Does $i have lovely food? $Variable\"\ndone\nDoes Greece have lovely food? Yes\nDoes Spain have lovely food? Yes\nDoes Britain have lovely food? Yes\nThe for loop went through the list Greece Spain Britain and printed a statement with each item in the list. What happens if we change the order of the list to Britain Greece Spain?\n#| eval: false\nVariable=Yes\nfor i in Britain Greece Spain; do\n  echo \"Does $i have lovely food? $Variable\"\ndone\nDoes Britain have lovely food? Yes\nDoes Greece have lovely food? Yes\nDoes Spain have lovely food? Yes\nWe see that changing the order of the list will affect the output, this is because the for loop will go through the list in a sequential manner.\nWe can also add more elements to the list, and the for loop will continue until it reaches the end of the list.",

This tutorial works with tidyverse ~v2.0. We will learn about the packages readr, tibble, ggplot2, dplyr, magrittr and tidyr. forcats will be briefly mentioned, but purrr and stringr are left out.\nThe palmerpenguins package (Horst, Hill, and Gorman 2020) provides a neat example dataset to learn data exploration and visualization in R (https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstructions for running this chapter without conda\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you wish to follow this chapter without installing conda, you can recreate the conda environment and data generation by running the following steps.\n\nInstall R and RStudio for your operating system according to one of the many instructions online (e.g. here)\nDownload the .qmd file underlying this webpage here and copy it to a new directory\nOpen RStudio and create a new project in this directory with File -&gt; New Project... -&gt; Existing directory\nOpen this very file from the RStudio project, so that you can easily follow along\nRun the Environment preparation code code to install necessary R package dependencies and prepare the required data used below\n\n\n# installing necessary R packages\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"palmerpenguins\"))\n\n# preparing data\n# (at the end of this tutorial\n# you will understand this code)\nlibrary(magrittr)\nset.seed(5678)\n\npeng_prepped &lt;- palmerpenguins::penguins %&gt;%\n    dplyr::filter(\n        !dplyr::if_any(\n            .cols = tidyselect::everything(),\n            .fns = is.na\n        )\n    ) %&gt;%\n    tibble::add_column(., id = 1:nrow(.), .before = \"species\")\n\npeng_prepped %&gt;%\n    dplyr::slice_sample(n = 300) %&gt;%\n    dplyr::arrange(id) %&gt;%\n    dplyr::select(-bill_length_mm, -bill_depth_mm) %&gt;%\n    readr::write_csv(\"penguins.csv\")\n\npeng_prepped %&gt;%\n    dplyr::slice_sample(n = 300) %&gt;%\n    dplyr::arrange(id) %&gt;%\n    dplyr::select(id, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm) %&gt;%\n    readr::write_csv(\"penguin_bills.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nTo load RStudio from within your conda environment, please run\n#| eval: false\nrstudio\nAnd the RStudio window will open.",

    "text": "7.2 Loading data into tibbles\n\n7.2.1 Reading data with readr\nWith R we usually operate on data in our computer’s memory. The tidyverse provides the package readr to read data from text files into the memory. readr can read from our file system or the internet. It provides functions to read data in almost any (text) format:\n\nreadr::read_csv() # .csv files -&gt; see penguins.csv\nreadr::read_tsv() # .tsv files\nreadr::read_delim() # tabular files with an arbitrary separator\nreadr::read_fwf() # fixed width files\nreadr::read_lines() # read linewise to parse yourself\n\n\n\n7.2.2 How does the interface of read_csv work?\nWe can learn more about an R function with the ? operator.\nTo open a help file for a specific function run ?&lt;function_name&gt; (e.g. ?readr::read_csv) in the R console. readr::read_csv has many options to specify how to read a text file.\n\nread_csv(\n    file, # The path to the file we want to read\n    col_names = TRUE, # Are there column names?\n    col_types = NULL, # Which types do the columns have? NULL -&gt; auto\n    locale = default_locale(), # How is information encoded in this file?\n    na = c(\"\", \"NA\"), # Which values mean \"no data\"\n    trim_ws = TRUE, # Should superfluous white-spaces be removed?\n    skip = 0, # Skip X lines at the beginning of the file\n    n_max = Inf, # Only read X lines\n    skip_empty_rows = TRUE, # Should empty lines be ignored?\n    comment = \"\", # Should comment lines be ignored?\n    name_repair = \"unique\", # How should \"broken\" column names be fixed\n    ...\n)\n\n\n\n7.2.3 What does readr produce? The tibble!\nTo read a .csv file (here \"penguins.csv\") into a variable (here peng_auto) run.\n\npeng_auto &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"penguins.csv\")\n\n\n\nRows: 300 Columns: 7\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (3): species, island, sex\ndbl (4): id, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, year\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nreadr first prints some information on the number and type of rows and columns it discovered in the file.\nIt automatically detects column types – but you can also define them manually.\n\npeng &lt;- readr::read_csv(\n    \"penguins.csv\",\n    col_types = \"iccddcc\" # this string encodes the desired types for each column\n)\n\nIt then returns an in-memory representation of this data, a tibble.\nA tibble is a “data frame”, a tabular data structure with rows and columns. Unlike a simple array, each column can have another data type.\n\n\n7.2.4 How to look at a tibble?\nTyping the name of any object into the R console will print an overview to the console.\n\npeng\n\n# A tibble: 300 × 7\n      id species island    flipper_length_mm body_mass_g sex    year \n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;\n 1     1 Adelie  Torgersen               181        3750 male   2007 \n 2     2 Adelie  Torgersen               186        3800 female 2007 \n 3     4 Adelie  Torgersen               193        3450 female 2007 \n 4     5 Adelie  Torgersen               190        3650 male   2007 \n 5     6 Adelie  Torgersen               181        3625 female 2007 \n 6     7 Adelie  Torgersen               195        4675 male   2007 \n 7     9 Adelie  Torgersen               191        3800 male   2007 \n 8    10 Adelie  Torgersen               198        4400 male   2007 \n 9    11 Adelie  Torgersen               185        3700 female 2007 \n10    12 Adelie  Torgersen               195        3450 female 2007 \n# ℹ 290 more rows\n\n\nBut there are various other ways to inspect the content of a tibble\n\nstr(peng) # a structural overview of an R object\nsummary(peng) # a human-readable summary of an R object\nView(peng) # open RStudio's interactive data browser",

    "section": "7.3 Plotting data in tibbles",
    "text": "7.3 Plotting data in tibbles\n\n7.3.1 ggplot2 and the “grammar of graphics”\nTo understand and present data, we usually have to visualize it.\nggplot2 is an R package that offers an unusual, but powerful and logical interface for this task (Wickham 2016). The following example describes a stacked bar chart.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2) # Loading a library to use its functions without ::\n\n\nggplot( # Every plot starts with a call to the ggplot() function\n    data = peng # This function can also take the input tibble\n) + # The plot consists of individual functions linked with \"+\"\n    geom_bar( # \"geoms\" define the plot layers we want to draw\n        mapping = aes( # The aes() function maps variables to visual properties\n            x = island, # publication_year -&gt; x-axis\n            fill = species # community_type   -&gt; fill color\n        )\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA geom_* combines data (here peng), a geometry (here vertical, stacked bars) and a statistical transformation (here counting the number of penguins per island and species). ggplot2 features many such geoms: A good overview is provided by this cheatsheet: https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/data-visualization.html.\nBeyond geoms, a ggplot plot can be further specified with (among others) scales, facets and themes.\n\n\n7.3.2 scales control the behaviour of visual elements\nHere is another plot to demonstrate this: Boxplots of penguin weight per species.\n\nggplot(peng) +\n    geom_boxplot(aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s assume we had some extreme outliers in this dataset. To simulate this, we replace some random weights with extreme values.\n\nset.seed(1234) # we set a seed for reproducible randomness\npeng_out &lt;- peng\npeng_out$body_mass_g[sample(1:nrow(peng_out), 10)] &lt;- 50000 + 50000 * runif(10)\n\nNow we plot the dataset with these “outliers”.\n\nggplot(peng_out) +\n    geom_boxplot(aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is not well readable, because the extreme outliers dictate the scale of the y-axis. A 50+kg penguin is a scary thought and we would probably remove these outliers, but let’s assume they are valid observation we want to include in the plot.\nTo mitigate this issue we can change the scale of different visual elements - e.g. the y-axis.\n\nggplot(peng_out) +\n    geom_boxplot(aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g)) +\n    scale_y_log10() # adding the log-scale improves readability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will now go back to the normal dataset without the artificial outliers.\n\n\n7.3.3 Colour scales\n(Fill) colour is a visual element of a plot and its scaling can be adjusted as well.\n\nggplot(peng) +\n    geom_boxplot(aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g, fill = species)) +\n    scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"C\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use the scale_* function to select one of the visually appealing (and robust to colourblindness) viridis colour palettes (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html).\n\n\n7.3.4 More variables! Defining plot matrices via facets\nIn the previous example we didn’t add additional information with the fill colour, as the plot already distinguished by species on the x-axis.\nWe can instead use colour to encode more information, for example by mapping the variable sex to it.\n\nggplot(peng) +\n    geom_boxplot(aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g, fill = sex))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother way to visualize more variables in one plot is to split the plot by categories into facets, so sub-plots per category.\nHere we split by sex, which is already mapped to the fill colour.\n\nggplot(peng) +\n    geom_boxplot(aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g, fill = sex)) +\n    facet_wrap(~sex)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fill colour is therefore free again to show yet another variable, for example the year a given penguin was examined.\n\nggplot(peng) +\n    geom_boxplot(aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g, fill = year)) +\n    facet_wrap(~sex)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.3.5 Setting purely aesthetic settings with theme\nAesthetic changes can be applied as part of the theme, which allows for very detailed configuration (see ?theme).\nHere we rotate the x-axis labels by 45°, which often helps to resolve overplotting.\n\nggplot(peng) +\n    geom_boxplot(aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g, fill = year)) +\n    facet_wrap(~sex) +\n    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.3.6 Ordering elements in a plot with factors\nR supports defining ordinal data with factors. This can be used to set the order of elements in a plot, e.g. the order of bars in a bar chart.\nWe do not cover factors beyond the following example here, although the tidyverse includes a package (forcats) specifically for that purpose.\nElements based on character columns are generally ordered alphabetically.\n\nggplot(peng) +\n    geom_bar(aes(x = species)) # bars are alphabetically ordered\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith forcats::fct_reorder we can transform an input vector to a factor, ordered by a summary statistic (even based on another vector).\n\npeng2 &lt;- peng\npeng2$species_ordered &lt;- forcats::fct_reorder(\n    peng2$species,\n    peng2$species, length\n)\n\nWith this change, the plot will be ordered according to the intrinsic order defined for species_ordered.\n\nggplot(peng2) +\n    geom_bar(aes(x = species_ordered)) # bars are ordered by size\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.3.7 Exercise\n\nLook at the mtcars dataset and read up on the meaning of its variables with the help operator ?. mtcars is a test dataset integrated in R and can be accessed by typing mtcars in the console\nVisualize the relationship between Gross horsepower and 1/4 mile time\n\n\nIntegrate the Number of cylinders into your plot as an additional variable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPossible solutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n?mtcars\n\n\nggplot(mtcars) +\n    geom_point(aes(x = hp, y = qsec))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(mtcars) +\n    geom_point(aes(x = hp, y = qsec, color = as.factor(cyl)))",

We can force this with .groups = \"drop\" to avoid undesired behaviour with this dataset later on.\n\n\n7.4.5 Sorting and slicing tibbles with arrange and slice\ndplyr allows to arrange tibbles by one or multiple columns.\n\npeng %&gt;% dplyr::arrange(sex) # sort by sex\n\n# A tibble: 300 × 7\n     id species island    flipper_length_mm body_mass_g sex    year \n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;\n1     2 Adelie  Torgersen               186        3800 female 2007 \n2     4 Adelie  Torgersen               193        3450 female 2007 \n3     6 Adelie  Torgersen               181        3625 female 2007 \n4    11 Adelie  Torgersen               185        3700 female 2007 \n5    12 Adelie  Torgersen               195        3450 female 2007 \n# ℹ 295 more rows\n\npeng %&gt;% dplyr::arrange(sex, body_mass_g) # sort by sex and weight\n\n# A tibble: 300 × 7\n     id species   island    flipper_length_mm body_mass_g sex    year \n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;\n1   304 Chinstrap Dream                   192        2700 female 2008 \n2    53 Adelie    Biscoe                  181        2850 female 2008 \n3    59 Adelie    Biscoe                  184        2850 female 2008 \n4    49 Adelie    Biscoe                  187        2900 female 2008 \n5   111 Adelie    Torgersen               188        2900 female 2009 \n# ℹ 295 more rows\n\npeng %&gt;% dplyr::arrange(dplyr::desc(body_mass_g)) # sort descending\n\n# A tibble: 300 × 7\n     id species island flipper_length_mm body_mass_g sex   year \n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;\n1   164 Gentoo  Biscoe               221        6300 male  2007 \n2   179 Gentoo  Biscoe               230        6050 male  2007 \n3   260 Gentoo  Biscoe               222        6000 male  2009 \n4   224 Gentoo  Biscoe               223        5950 male  2008 \n5   160 Gentoo  Biscoe               213        5850 male  2007 \n# ℹ 295 more rows\n\n\nSorting also works within groups and can be paired with slice to extract extreme values per group.\nHere we extract the heaviest individuals per species.\n\npeng %&gt;%\n    dplyr::group_by(species) %&gt;% # group by species\n    dplyr::arrange(dplyr::desc(body_mass_g)) %&gt;% # sort by weight within (!) groups\n    dplyr::slice_head(n = 3) %&gt;% # keep the first three penguins per group\n    dplyr::ungroup() # remove the still lingering grouping\n\n# A tibble: 9 × 7\n     id species   island    flipper_length_mm body_mass_g sex   year \n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;\n1   104 Adelie    Biscoe                  197        4775 male  2009 \n2    96 Adelie    Biscoe                  203        4725 male  2009 \n3    76 Adelie    Torgersen               196        4700 male  2008 \n4   303 Chinstrap Dream                   210        4800 male  2008 \n5   295 Chinstrap Dream                   205        4550 male  2008 \n# ℹ 4 more rows\n\n\nSlicing is also the relevant operation to take random samples from the observations in a tibble.\n\npeng %&gt;% dplyr::slice_sample(n = 10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 7\n     id species island flipper_length_mm body_mass_g sex    year \n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;\n1    47 Adelie  Biscoe               190        3450 female 2008 \n2   239 Gentoo  Biscoe               214        4850 female 2009 \n3   221 Gentoo  Biscoe               209        4600 female 2008 \n4   104 Adelie  Biscoe               197        4775 male   2009 \n5   138 Adelie  Dream                190        3725 male   2009 \n# ℹ 5 more rows\n\n\n\n\n7.4.6 Exercise\nFor this exercise we once more go back to the mtcars dataset.

Conversion from wide to long makes the long-format so that the first columnn still has categories, but the second column becomes the column-categories from the first row, and third column has values. Converting long format back to wider shows again first row and column as categories and cells as values).\n\n\n\n\nA table in wide format has N key columns and N value columns.\nA table in long format has N key columns, one descriptor column and one value column.\n\nHere is an example of a wide dataset. It features information about the number of cars sold per year per brand at a dealership.\n\ncarsales &lt;- tibble::tribble(\n    ~brand, ~`2014`, ~`2015`, ~`2016`, ~`2017`,\n    \"BMW\", 20, 25, 30, 45,\n    \"VW\", 67, 40, 120, 55\n)\ncarsales\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 5\n  brand `2014` `2015` `2016` `2017`\n  &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 BMW       20     25     30     45\n2 VW        67     40    120     55\n\n\nWide format data becomes a problem, when the columns are semantically identical. This dataset is in wide format and we can not easily plot it. We generally prefer data in long format, although it is more verbose with more duplication.\nTo transform this dataset to a long format, we can apply tidyr::pivot_longer.\n\ncarsales_long &lt;- carsales %&gt;% tidyr::pivot_longer(\n    cols = tidyselect::num_range(\n        \"\",\n        range = 2014:2017\n    ), # define a set of columns to transform\n    names_to = \"year\", # the name of the descriptor column we want\n    names_transform = as.integer, # a transformation function to apply to the names\n    values_to = \"sales\" # the name of the value column we want\n)\ncarsales_long\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 3\n  brand  year sales\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 BMW    2014    20\n2 BMW    2015    25\n3 BMW    2016    30\n4 BMW    2017    45\n5 VW     2014    67\n# ℹ 3 more rows\n\n\nWide datasets are not always the wrong choice, for example for adjacency matrices to represent graphs, covariance matrices or other pairwise statistics. When data gets big, then wide formats can be significantly more efficient (e.g. for spatial data).\nSo transform data from long to wide, we can use tidyr::pivot_wider\n\ncarsales_wide &lt;- carsales_long %&gt;% tidyr::pivot_wider(\n    id_cols = \"brand\", # the set of id columns that should not be changed\n    names_from = year, # the descriptor column with the names of the new columns\n    values_from = sales # the value column from which the values should be extracted\n)\ncarsales_wide\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 5\n  brand `2014` `2015` `2016` `2017`\n  &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 BMW       20     25     30     45\n2 VW        67     40    120     55\n\n\n\n\n7.5.4 Exercise\n\nMove the column gear to the first position of the mtcars dataset\n\n\nMake a new dataset mtcars2 with the column mpg and an additional column am_v, which encodes the transmission type (am) as either \"manual\" or \"automatic\"\n\n\nCount the number of cars per transmission type (am_v) and number of gears (gear). Then transform the result to a wide format, with one column per transmission type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPossible solutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmtcars %&gt;%\n    dplyr::relocate(gear, .before = mpg) %&gt;%\n    tibble::as_tibble() # transforming the raw dataset for better printing\n\n# A tibble: 32 × 11\n   gear   mpg   cyl  disp    hp  drat    wt  qsec    vs    am  carb\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     4  21       6   160   110  3.9   2.62  16.5     0     1     4\n2     4  21       6   160   110  3.9   2.88  17.0     0     1     4\n3     4  22.8     4   108    93  3.85  2.32  18.6     1     1     1\n4     3  21.4     6   258   110  3.08  3.22  19.4     1     0     1\n5     3  18.7     8   360   175  3.15  3.44  17.0     0     0     2\n# ℹ 27 more rows\n\n\n\nmtcars2 &lt;- mtcars %&gt;%\n    dplyr::mutate(\n        gear,\n        am_v = dplyr::case_match(\n            am,\n            0 ~ \"automatic\",\n            1 ~ \"manual\"\n        )\n    ) %&gt;%\n    tibble::as_tibble()\nmtcars2\n\n# A tibble: 32 × 12\n    mpg   cyl  disp    hp  drat    wt  qsec    vs    am  gear  carb am_v     \n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    \n1  21       6   160   110  3.9   2.62  16.5     0     1     4     4 manual   \n2  21       6   160   110  3.9   2.88  17.0     0     1     4     4 manual   \n3  22.8     4   108    93  3.85  2.32  18.6     1     1     4     1 manual   \n4  21.4     6   258   110  3.08  3.22  19.4     1     0     3     1 automatic\n5  18.7     8   360   175  3.15  3.44  17.0     0     0     3     2 automatic\n# ℹ 27 more rows\n\n\n\nmtcars2 %&gt;%\n    dplyr::group_by(am_v, gear) %&gt;%\n    dplyr::tally() %&gt;% # dplyr::tally() is identical to\n    # dplyr::summarise(n = dplyr::n())\n    # it counts the number of entities in a group\n    tidyr::pivot_wider(\n        names_from = am_v,\n        values_from = n\n    )\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n   gear automatic manual\n  &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;int&gt;  &lt;int&gt;\n1     3        15     NA\n2     4         4      8\n3     5        NA      5",

Two tables with a shared first column (A B C, and A B D respectively) are merged together to have columns A B C D.

    "text": "8.1 Working in a Jupyter environment\nThis tutorial/walkthrough is using a Jupyter Notebook (https://jupyter.org) for writing and executing Python code and for annotating.\nJupyter notebooks have two types of cells: Markdown and Code. The Markdown cell syntax is very similar to R markdown. The markdown cells are used for annotating code, which is important for sharing work with collaborators, reproducibility, and documentation.\nChange the directory to the the working directory of this tutorial/walkthrough.\nTo launch jupyter, run the following command in the terminal. This will open a browser window with jupyter running.\nJupyter Notebook should have a file structure with all the files from the working directory. Open the student-notebook.ipynb notebook by clicking on it. This notebook has exactly the same code as written in this book chapter and is only a support so that it is not necessary to copy and paste the code. It is of course also possible to copy the code from this chapter into a fresh notebook file by clicking on: File &gt; New &gt; Notebook.",

Make sure that pwd returns /vol/volume/python-pandas/python-pandas_lecture.\n\n\n\n\n8.1.1 Creating and running cells\nThere are multiple ways of making a new cells in jupyter, such as typing the letter b, or using the cursor on the bottom of the page that says click to add cell. The cells can be assigned to code or markdown using the drop down menu at the top. Code cells are always in edit mode. Code can be run with pressing Shift + Enter or click on the ▶ botton. To make an markdown cell active, double-click on a markdown cell, it switches from display mode to edit mode. To leave the editing mode by running the cell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your code cells\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore starting it might be nice to clear the output of all code cells, by clicking on:\nedit &gt; Clear outputs of All Cells\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.2 Markdown cell syntax\nHere a few examples of the syntax for the Markdown cells are shown, such as making words bold, or italics. For a more comprehensive list with syntax check out this Jupyter Notebook cheat-sheet (https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watson-studio-local/1.2.3?topic=notebooks-markdown-jupyter-cheatsheet).\nList of markdown cell examples:\n\n**bold** : bold\n_italics_ : italics\n\nCode\n\n`inline code` : inline code\n\nLaTeX maths\n\n$ x = \\frac{\\pi}{42} $ : \\[ x = \\frac{\\pi}{42} \\]\n\nURL links\n\n[link](https://www.python.org/) : link\n\nImages\n\n![](https://www.spaam-community.org/assets/media/SPAAM-Logo-Full-Colour_ShortName.svg) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll roads lead to Rome\n\n\n\n\n\nIn many cases, there are multiple syntaxes, or ‘ways of doing things,’ that will give the same results. For each section in this tutorial/walkthrough, one way is presented.\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.3 code cell syntax\nThe code cells can interpret many different coding languages including Python and Bash. The syntax of the code cells is the same as the syntax of the coding languages, in our case python.\nBelow are some examples of Python code cells with some useful basic python functions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPython function print()\n\n\n\n\n\nprint() is a python function for printing lines in the terminal\nprint() is the same as echo in bash\n\n\n\nprint(\"Hello World from Python!\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see output\n\n\n\n\n\nHello World from Python!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning bash code in Jupyter\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is also possible to run bash commands in Jupyter, by adding a ! at the start of the line.\n! echo \"Hello World from bash!\"\nHello World from bash!\n\n\n\nStings or numbers can be stored as a variable by using the = sign.\ni = 0\nOnes a variable is set in one code cell they are stored and can be accessed in other downstream code cells.\nTo see what value a variable contains, the print() function can be used.\nprint(i)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see output\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\nYou can also print multiple things together in one print statement such as a number and a string:\nprint(\"The number is\", i, \"Wow!\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see output\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number is, 0, Wow!",

A Series is a one-dimensional array-like object containing a value of the same type and can be imagined as one column in a table Figure 8.1. Each element in the series is associated with an index from 0 to the number of elements, but these can be changed to labels. A DataFrame is two-dimensional, and can change in size after it is created by adding and removing rows and columns, which can hold different types of data such as numbers and strings Figure 8.2. The columns and rows are labelled. By default, rows are unnamed and are indexed similarly to a series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1: A single row or column (1-dimensional data) is a Series. The dark grey squares are the index or row names, and the light grey squares are the elements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.2: A dataframe with columns and rows. The dark grey squares are the index/row names and the column names. The light grey squares are the values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore details on pandas\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a more in detail pandas getting started tutorial click here (https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/index.html#)",

Here is the link to the original source (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis) for more information.\n\n8.4.1 Columns\nTo display all the column names from the imported DataFrame, the attribute columns can be called.\ndf.columns\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see output\n\n\n\n\n\nIndex(['ID', 'Year_Birth', 'Education', 'Marital_Status', 'Income', 'Kidhome',\n       'Teenhome', 'MntWines', 'MntFruits', 'MntMeatProducts',\n       'MntFishProducts', 'MntSweetProducts', 'MntGoldProds',\n       'NumWebPurchases', 'NumCatalogPurchases', 'NumStorePurchases',\n       'NumWebVisitsMonth', 'Complain', 'Z_CostContact', 'Z_Revenue'],\n      dtype='object')\n\n\n\nEach column has its own data types which are highly optimised.

When it is known that a value is in a certain range, it is possible to change the bits to 8, 16, or 32. This chosing the correct range might reduce memory usage, to be save, 64 range is so large it will incorporate most user cases.\ndf['Kidhome'] = df['Kidhome'].astype('int8')\n\n\n\n\n\n8.4.2 Inspecting the DataFrame\nTo quikly check how many rows and columns the DataFrame has, you can access the shape attribute.\ndf.shape\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see output\n\n\n\n\n\n(1754, 20)\n\n\n\nThe .shape attribute of a DataFrame provides a tuple representing its dimensions. A tuple is a Python data structure that is used to store ordered items. In the case of shape, the first item is always the row, and the second item is the columns. To print, or access the rows or columns the index can be used. .shape[0] gives the number of rows, and .shape[1] gives the number of columns.\ndf.shape[0]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see output\n\n\n\n\n\n1754\n\n\n\ndf.shape[1]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see output\n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIt is often useful to have a quick look at the first rows, to get, for example, an idea of the data was read correctly.

While .shape is an attribute and will return a value that is already stored in the DataFrame.\n\n\n\nWhat we can see it that, unlike R, Python and in extension Pandas is 0-indexed instead of 1-indexed.\n\n\n8.4.3 Accessing rows and columns\nIt is possible to access parts of the data in DataFrames in different ways. The first method is sub-setting rows using the row name and column name. This can be done with the .loc, which loc ates row(s) by providing the row name and column name [row, column]. When the rows are not named, the row index can be used instead. To print the second row, this would be index 1 since the index in Python starts at 0. To print the all the columns, the : is used.\ndf.loc[1, :]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see output\n\n\n\n\n\nID                           2174\nYear_Birth                   1954\nEducation              Graduation\nMarital_Status             Single\nIncome                    46344.0\nKidhome                         1\nTeenhome                        1\nMntWines                       11\nMntFruits                       1\nMntMeatProducts                 6\nMntFishProducts                 2\nMntSweetProducts                1\nMntGoldProds                    6\nNumWebPurchases                 1\nNumCatalogPurchases             1\nNumStorePurchases               2\nNumWebVisitsMonth               5\nComplain                        0\nZ_CostContact                   3\nZ_Revenue                      11\nName: 1, dtype: object\n\n\n\nTo print a range of rows, the first and last index can be written with a :.

To keep the changes, the DataFrame has to be actively stored using the same name or a new variable.\nTo save the changes, a new DataFrame has to be created, or the existing DataFrame has to be overwritten. This can be done by directing the output to a variable with =. To make a new DataFrame with only the “Education” and “Marital_Status” columns, the column names have to be placed in a list ['colname1', 'colname2'].\ndf.head()\nnew_df = df.loc[:, [\"Education\", \"Marital_Status\"]]\nnew_df\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see output\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation\nMarital_Status\n\n\n\n\n0\nGraduation\nSingle\n\n\n1\nGraduation\nSingle\n\n\n2\nGraduation\nTogether\n\n\n3\nGraduation\nTogether\n\n\n4\nMaster\nTogether\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n1749\nGraduation\nTogether\n\n\n1750\nGraduation\nMarried\n\n\n1751\nGraduation\nMarried\n\n\n1752\nGraduation\nDivorced\n\n\n1753\nMaster\nTogether\n\n\n1754 rows × 2 columns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is also possible to remove rows and columns from a DataFrame. This can be done with the function drop() To remove the columns Z_CostContact and Z_Revenue and keep those changes, it is necessary to overwrite the DataFrame. To make sure Pandas understands that the its columns that need to be removed, the axis can be specified. Rows are called axis=0, and columns are called axis=1. In most cases Pandas will guess correctly without specifying the axis, since in this case the no row is called Z_CostContact or Z_Revenue. It is however good practice to add the axis to make sure Pandas is operating as expected.\ndf = df.drop(\"Z_CostContact\", axis=1)\ndf = df.drop(\"Z_Revenue\", axis=1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan be done in one go\n\n\n\n\n\ndf = df.drop([\"Z_CostContact\", \"Z_Revenue\"], axis=1)\n\n\n\n\n\n8.4.4 Conditional subsetting\nSo far, all the subsetting has been based on row names and column names. However, in many cases, it is more helpful to look only at data that contain certain items. This can be done using conditional subsetting, which is based on Boolean values True or False. pandas will interpret a series of True and False values by printing only the rows or columns where a True is present and ignoring all rows or columns with a False.\nFor example, if we are only interested in individuals in the table who graduated, we can test each string in the column Education to see if it is equal (==) to Graduation. This will return a series with Boolean values True or False.\neducation_is_grad = (df[\"Education\"] == \"Graduation\")\neducation_is_grad\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see output\n\n\n\n\n\n0        True\n1        True\n2        True\n3        True\n4       False\n        ...  \n1749     True\n1750     True\n1751     True\n1752     True\n1753    False\nName: Education, Length: 1754, dtype: bool\n\n\n\nTo quicky check if the True and False values are correct, it can be useful to print out this column.\ndf[\"Education\"]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see output\n\n\n\n\n\n0       Graduation\n1       Graduation\n2       Graduation\n3       Graduation\n4       Master\n…       …\n1749    Graduation\n1750    Graduation\n1751    Graduation\n1752    Graduation\n1753    Master\nName: Education, length: 1754, dtype: object\n\n\n\nIt is possible to provide pandas with multiple conditions at the same time.

One of these functions is .groupby() with the arguments by=..., which will group a DataFrame using a categorical column (for example Education or Marital_Status). This makes it possible to perform operations on a group directly without the need for subsetting. For example, to get a mean income value for the different Education levels in the DataFrame can be done by specifying the column name for the grouping variable by .groupby(by='Education') and specifying the column name to perform this action on [Income] followed by the sum() function.\ndf.groupby(by=\"Education\")[\"Income\"].mean()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see output\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation\n2n Cycle      47633.190000\nBasic         20306.259259\nGraduation    52720.373656\nMaster        52917.534247\nName: Income, dtype: float6\n\n\n\n\n\n8.4.7 Subsetting Questions and Exercises\nHere there are several exercises to try conditional subsetting.

This function will by default remove the row with the NA but with specficing the axis=1 the column will be dropped. The second course of action is filling the empty cells with a value, this can be done with the .fillna() function, which will substitute the missing value with a set value, such as 0.",

One way to combine multiple datasets is through concatenation, which either combines all columns or rows of multiple DataFrames. The function in Pandas that does just that is called .concat. This command combines two DataFrames by appending all rows or columns: .concat([first_dataframe, second_dataframe]).\nIn the DataFrame, there are individuals with the education levels Graduation, Master, Basic, and 2n Cycle. PhD is missing; however, there is data on people with the education level PhD in another table called phd_data.tsv.\nWith everything learned so far, and basic information on the .concat()function, try to read in the data from ../phd_data.tsv and concatenate it to the existing df.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nRead the tsv “phd_data.tsv” as a new DataFrame and name the variable df2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\ndf2 = pd.read_csv(\"../phd_data.tsv\", sep=\"\\t\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nConcatenate the “old” DataFrame df and the new df2 and name the concatenated one concat_df.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nconcat_df = pd.concat([df, df2])\nconcat_df\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see output\n\n\n\n\n\n||ID|Year_Birth|Education|Marital_Status|Income|Kidhome|Teenhome|MntWines|MntFruits|MntMeatProducts|MntFishProducts|MntSweetProducts|MntGoldProds|NumWebPurchases|NumCatalogPurchases|NumStorePurchases|NumWebVisitsMonth|Complain|Z_CostContact|Z_Revenue| |0|5524|1957|Graduation|Single|58138.0|0|0|635|88|546|172|88|88|8|10|4|7|0|3|11| |1|2174|1954|Graduation|Single|46344.0|1|1|11|1|6|2|1|6|1|1|2|5|0|3|11| |2|4141|1965|Graduation|Together|71613.0|0|0|426|49|127|111|21|42|8|2|10|4|0|3|11| |3|6182|1984|Graduation|Together|26646.0|1|0|11|4|20|10|3|5|2|0|4|6|0|3|11| |4|7446|1967|Master|Together|62513.0|0|1|520|42|98|0|42|14|6|4|10|6|0|3|11| |…|…|…|…|…|…|…|…|…|…|…|…|…|…|…|…|…|…|…|…|…| |481|11133|1973|PhD|YOLO|48432.0|0|1|322|3|50|4|3|42|7|1|6|8|0|3|11| |482|9589|1948|PhD|Widow|82032.0|0|0|332|194|377|149|125|57|4|6|7|1|0|3|11| |483|4286|1970|PhD|Single|57642.0|0|1|580|6|58|8|0|27|7|6|6|4|0|3|11| |484|4001|1946|PhD|Together|64014.0|2|1|406|0|30|0|0|8|8|2|5|7|0|3|11| |485|9405|1954|PhD|Married|52869.0|1|1|84|3|61|2|1|21|3|1|4|7|0|3|11| 2240 rows × 20 columns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nIs there anything weird about the new DataFrame and can you fix that?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nWe previously removed the columns “Z_CostContact” and “Z_Revenue” but they are in the new data again.\nWe can remove them like before.\nconcat_df = concat_df.drop(\"Z_CostContact\", axis=1)\nconcat_df = concat_df.drop(\"Z_Revenue\", axis=1)\nconcat_df\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see output\n\n\n\n\n\n||ID|Year_Birth|Education|Marital_Status|Income|Kidhome|Teenhome|MntWines|MntFruits|MntMeatProducts|MntFishProducts|MntSweetProducts|MntGoldProds|NumWebPurchases|NumCatalogPurchases|NumStorePurchases|NumWebVisitsMonth|Complain| |0|5524|1957|Graduation|Single|58138.0|0|0|635|88|546|172|88|88|8|10|4|7|0| |1|2174|1954|Graduation|Single|46344.0|1|1|11|1|6|2|1|6|1|1|2|5|0| |2|4141|1965|Graduation|Together|71613.0|0|0|426|49|127|111|21|42|8|2|10|4|0| |3|6182|1984|Graduation|Together|26646.0|1|0|11|4|20|10|3|5|2|0|4|6|0| |4|7446|1967|Master|Together|62513.0|0|1|520|42|98|0|42|14|6|4|10|6|0| |…|…|…|…|…|…|…|…|…|…|…|…|…|…|…|…|…|…|…| |481|11133|1973|PhD|YOLO|48432.0|0|1|322|3|50|4|3|42|7|1|6|8|0| |482|9589|1948|PhD|Widow|82032.0|0|0|332|194|377|149|125|57|4|6|7|1|0| |483|4286|1970|PhD|Single|57642.0|0|1|580|6|58|8|0|27|7|6|6|4|0| |484|4001|1946|PhD|Together|64014.0|2|1|406|0|30|0|0|8|8|2|5|7|0| |485|9405|1954|PhD|Married|52869.0|1|1|84|3|61|2|1|21|3|1|4|7|0| 2240 rows × 18 columns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nIs there something interesting about the marital status of some people that have a PhD?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nconcat_df[concat_df[\"Education\"]==\"PhD\"][\"Marital_Status\"].value_counts()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see output\n\n\n\n\n\nMarital_Status\nMarried     192\nTogether    117\nSingle       98\nDivorced     52\nWidow        24\nYOLO          2\nAlone         1\nName: count, dtype: int64\n\n\n\nThere are two people that have “YOLO” as their Marital Status …\n\n\n\n\n\n8.6.2 Merging\nBesides concatenating two DataFrames, there is another powerful function for combining data from multiple sources: .merge(). This function is especially useful when you have different types of related data in separate tables. For example, you might have a taxonomy table with count data per sample and a metadata table in another DataFrame.\nThe pandas function .merge() allows you to combine these DataFrames based on a common column. This column must exist in both DataFrames and contain similar values.\nTo illustrate the .merge() function, we will create a new DataFrame and merge it with the existing one. Let’s rank the different education levels from 1 to 5 in a new DataFrame and merge this with the existing DataFrame.\nAs shown before, there are multiple ways of making a new DataFrame. Here, we first create a dictionary and then use the from_dict() function to transform this into a DataFrame.\nThe from_dict() function will by default use the keys() of the dictionary as column names. A dictionary is made up of {'key':'value'} pairs. To specify that we want the keys() as rows, the orient= argument has to be set to index. This means that the row names are the dictionary keys().\neducation_dictionary = {\n    \"Basic\": 1,\n    \"2n Cycle\": 2,\n    \"Graduation\": 3,\n    \"Master\": 4,\n    \"PhD\": 5\n}\n\neducation_df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(education_dictionary, orient=\"index\")\neducation_df\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see output\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\nBasic\n1\n\n\n2n Cycle\n2\n\n\nGraduation\n3\n\n\nMaster\n4\n\n\nPhD\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe resulting DataFrame has the Education level as index “row names” and the column name is 0.\nThe 0 is not a particular useful name for our new column, so we can use the .rename() function to change this.\neducation_df = education_df.rename(columns={0: \"Level\"})\neducation_df\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see output\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\n\n\n\n\nBasic\n1\n\n\n2n Cycle\n2\n\n\nGraduation\n3\n\n\nMaster\n4\n\n\nPhD\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that there is a new DataFrame with all the needed information, we can merge it with our previous concat_df on the Education column. The .merge() function requires several arguments: left=, which is the DataFrame that will be on the left side of the merge, in our case concat_df; right=, which is the DataFrame that will be on the right side of the merge, which is education_df; left_on=, specifying the column to merge on from the left DataFrame concat_df, which is Education; and right_index=True, indicating that the right DataFrame education_df should be merged using its index. If the values were in a column instead of the index, we would use right_on= instead.\nThe right one is education_df and the information is in the index.\nmerged_df = pd.merge(left=concat_df, right=education_df, left_on=\"Education\", right_index=True)\nmerged_df\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see output\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID\nYear_Birth\nEducation\nMarital_Status\nIncome\nKidhome\nTeenhome\nMntWines\nMntFruits\nMntMeatProducts\nMntFishProducts\nMntSweetProducts\nMntGoldProds\nNumWebPurchases\nNumCatalogPurchases\nNumStorePurchases\nNumWebVisitsMonth\nComplain\nLevel\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n5524\n1957\nGraduation\nSingle\n58138.0\n0\n0\n635\n88\n546\n172\n88\n88\n8\n10\n4\n7\n0\n3\n\n\n1\n2174\n1954\nGraduation\nSingle\n46344.0\n1\n1\n11\n1\n6\n2\n1\n6\n1\n1\n2\n5\n0\n3\n\n\n2\n4141\n1965\nGraduation\nTogether\n71613.0\n0\n0\n426\n49\n127\n111\n21\n42\n8\n2\n10\n4\n0\n3\n\n\n3\n6182\n1984\nGraduation\nTogether\n26646.0\n1\n0\n11\n4\n20\n10\n3\n5\n2\n0\n4\n6\n0\n3\n\n\n5\n965\n1971\nGraduation\nDivorced\n55635.0\n0\n1\n235\n65\n164\n50\n49\n27\n7\n3\n7\n6\n0\n3\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n481\n11133\n1973\nPhD\nYOLO\n48432.0\n0\n1\n322\n3\n50\n4\n3\n42\n7\n1\n6\n8\n0\n5\n\n\n482\n9589\n1948\nPhD\nWidow\n82032.0\n0\n0\n332\n194\n377\n149\n125\n57\n4\n6\n7\n1\n0\n5\n\n\n483\n4286\n1970\nPhD\nSingle\n57642.0\n0\n1\n580\n6\n58\n8\n0\n27\n7\n6\n6\n4\n0\n5\n\n\n484\n4001\n1946\nPhD\nTogether\n64014.0\n2\n1\n406\n0\n30\n0\n0\n8\n8\n2\n5\n7\n0\n5\n\n\n485\n9405\n1954\nPhD\nMarried\n52869.0\n1\n1\n84\n3\n61\n2\n1\n21\n3\n1\n4\n7\n0\n5\n\n\n\n2240 rows × 19 columns",

    "text": "8.7 Data visualisation\nJust looking at DataFrames is nice and useful, but in many cases, it is easier to look at data in graphs. The function that can create plots directly from DataFrames is .plot(). The .plot() function uses the plotting library matplotlib by default in the background. There are other plotting libraries such as Plotnine which will be shown further in the tutorial.\nThe only arguments .plot() requires are kind=..., and the plot axis x=... and y=.... The kind argument specifies the type of plot, such as hist for histogram, bar for bar plot, and scatter for scatter plot. Check out the Pandas documentation (https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.plot.html) for more plot kinds and useful syntax. There are many aesthetic functions that can help to create beautiful plots. These functions such as .set_xlabel() or ,set_title() are added to the plot, as shown in the examples below.\n\n8.7.1 Histogram\nax = merged_df.plot(kind=\"hist\", y=\"Income\")\nax.set_xlabel(\"Income\")\nax.set_title(\"Histogram of income\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see output\n\n\n\n\n\nText(0.5, 1.0, ‘Histogram of income’)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.3: This is the histogram of income that should appear with you run the code above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nThis does not look very good because the x-axis extends so much!

We wrote Python code and executed it in a Jupyter Notebook, with just a handful of functions such as .read_csv(), .loc[], drop(), merge(), .concat() andplot()`, we have done data manipulation, calculated summary statistics, and plotted the data. The takeaway messages therefore are:\n\nPython, Pandas and Jupyter Notebook are relatively easy to use and powerful for data analysis.\nIf you know R and R markdown, the syntax of Python is easy to learn.\n\nThese functions in this chapter and the general idea of the Python syntax should help you get started using Python on your data.",

    "text": "9.1 Background\nWhat is a version control system? This is a general term for tools that allow us to track changes to objects - in this case files - over time. When it comes to bioinformatics, this is typically files such as scripts or notebooks, or simple text files such as CSV and FASTAs (although it can also apply to much larger binary files!). The use of a good version control system allows the restoration of old versions, modification to previous changes, tracking contributions by multiple people etc. By far the most popular version control system in bioinformatics is git - which was in fact also originally co-written by the creator of the Linux operating system!\nNowadays it is popular to include a remote hosting service for version-controlled repositories. In bioinformatics, the most popular remote hosting service for Git version controlled code repositories is GitHub. While other open-source alternatives exist (e.g. GitLab or BitBucket), the most popular in bioinformatics is GitHub. It provides a user-friendly GUI and a range of other useful tools and functionality, in addition to most bioinformatic code and tools are hosted there.\nSo why should you use a version control system, such as GitHub?",

See chapter text for description of image. Reconstructed and modified after Chacon and Straub (2014).\n\n\n\nIn the diagram of Figure 9.1, the two dark gray boxes represent a local machine (e.g. a laptop) and a remote server. Within the local machine, an ‘untracked’ box represent files not indexed by the local git repository.\nThe arrow pointing into a light grey box (the local repository) in which three white boxes are present. These represent different ‘stages’ of an object of the repository.\nThis first arrow from the ‘untracked’ box then spans to the furthest box called ‘staged’, which is the operation when we add a file to be indexed by the repository (this only happens once).\nOnce staged, the arrow pointing from the ‘staged’ box back to the first box or ‘status’ within the local repository, called ‘unmodified’. This arrow, converting a staged file to unmodified, represents making a ‘commit’ (i.e. recording to git history a repository change). We can imagine committing to be equivalent to a permanent(!) save.\nThe next arrow represents an edit to a file, which spans the ‘unmodified’ box to the middle ‘modified’ status. Once all edits have been made, the edited file is ‘staged’ - the arrow that goes from the middle of the ‘modified’ state to the ‘staged’ state - after which a commit again would be made to record that file as ‘unmodified’ compared to the change history.\nThe arrow pointing from the local repository back to the furthest left ‘untracked’ state of the local repository represents the removal of the file from indexing/tracking in the git history.\nFinally the two arrows that span between the local machine and remote server - one going from the local repository to the a remote repository (on the server) - represent ‘push ing’ the commit history to the server, and in the reverse direction - ‘pull ing’ the commit history back to the local repository.\nThese can be imagined as backing-up our git history to a cloud server, and the retrieving the backup (albeit with changes from others)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nWhy do you think it is important to have a ‘staging’ areas of changes before committing them to the git history?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can be useful when you are adding multiple modifications to multiple files, that all address the same ‘fix’ or ‘function’.\nBy staging the files, you can commit them all at once, and have a single entry in the git history that describes all the changes you made.",

These are special cryptographic strings of characters and numbers. When generating a pair, we get both a ‘private’ and ‘public’ key. The former we keep privately, whereas the other we upload to other servers/people. When we want to ‘prove’ that it’s us sending changes to the repository, we securely send the private key and this gets compared with the corresponding public key that we uploaded on the remote server. If after some cryptographic maths magic they match, the server will trust us and will accept our changes.",

    "text": "9.4 Using ssh keys for passwordless interaction with GitHub\nSo, to begin, we will set up an SSH key to facilitate easier authentication when transferring data between local and remote repositories. In other words, follow this section of the tutorial so that we never have to type in our github password again!\n\n9.4.1 Creating SSH keys\nFirst, we can generate our own ssh key pair, replacing the email below with our own email address.\nssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"&lt;YOUR_EMAIL&gt;@&lt;EXAMPLE&gt;.com\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe -t flag tells the command which cryptographic algorithm to use.\n\n\nWhen we type this command, we will be asked a range of questions:\n\nEnter file which to save key: here we suggest keep as default\nEnter passphrase: _don’t specify one here (unless we want to be ultra secure), just press enter\nEnter same passphrase again: same as 2 (i.e., recommended - just press enter without any password)\n\nWe should now (hopefully!) have generated an ssh key. This is normally indicated by a ‘randomart image’ being pasted to console.\nA random art image normally looks like something like:\n+--[ RSA 2048]----+\n|       o=.       |\n|    o  o++E      |\n|   + . Ooo.      |\n|    + O B..      |\n|     = *S.       |\n|      o          |\n|                 |\n|                 |\n|                 |\n+-----------------+\nTo check that it worked, we can change into the default directory where keys are stored. By default on UNIX operating system this is in our home directory under a folder called .ssh. Lets change into that directory, and check the contents.\ncd ~/.ssh/\nls id*\nWe should now see two files: id_ed25519, and id_ed25519.pub.\nThe first is a private key. This we should not share this any one, and should always stay on our local machine.\nThe second file (ending in .pub), is a public key. This we can give to others, on remote servers, or websites, to allow those places to know it is us.\nSo lets try this out on GitHub!\n\n\n9.4.2 Logging the keys\nFirst, we need to tell our computer that the keys exist and should be used for validation to remote locations. The tool that does that is called ssh-agent. We can check if it is running with the following command.\neval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"\nIf it’s running, we should get a text such as Agent pid &lt;NUMBERS&gt;.\nIf it’s not running, see the GitHub documentation for more information.\n\nAn operating system assigns each running program a unique number ID. If a program isn’t running, it won’t have a process ID!\n\nWhen the agent is running, we need to give the path to the private key file as follows.\nssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519\n\n\n9.4.3 Registering keys on GitHub\nNext, GitHub needs to have our public key on record so it can compare between the public and private keys. Open our web browser and navigate to the github account settings page (typically: press the profile picture in the top bar menu, then settings).\nThen, under settings, in the side bar go to SSH & GPG Keys (Figure 9.2), then press New SSH Key (Figure 9.3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.2: Screenshot of Github settings page sidebar (as of August 2023), with the ‘SSH and GPG keys’ section highlighted under the ‘Access’ section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.3: Screenshot of the top of the Github SSH and GPG keys page (as of August 2023), with a green ‘New SSH Key’ button.\n\n\n\nWhen in the ‘new SHH key’ page, we can give key a title (e.g. the local machine the key was generated on). Leave the ‘Key type’ as ‘Authentication Key’ Then paste the entire contents of public key into the main text box that we just generated on our local machine.\ncat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIt’s very important to paste the whole string! This starts with ssh-ed (or whatever algorithm used) and ending in our email address.\n\n\nFinally, press the Add SSH key. To check that it worked, we run the following command on our local machine.\nssh -T git@github.com\nWe should see a message along the lines of the following\nHi &lt;YOUR_USERNAME&gt;! you that you've successfully authenticated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf we get a message saying something such as.\nThe authenticity of host 'github.com (140.82.121.3)' can't be established.\nType yes on the keyboard and press enter.\n\n\nFor more information about setting up the SSH key, including instructions for different operating systems, check out github’s documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nWhat are the benefits of using SSH keys for authentication with GitHub?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe don’t have to remember our password every time we push or pull from GitHub\nIt helps make it easier to get into the habit of regular commits, pushes, and pulls\nIt’s more secure than using a password!",

    "text": "9.6 The only 6 commands you only need to really know\nWe have set all our authentication keys for GitHub, and created a new repository. We can now run through the some of the concepts we learnt in the Basic Workflow section.\nThis can be boiled down to just six that we really need to work with for Git(Hub) for basic version control of all our software, scripts, and (small) data!\nTo start, create and change into the chapter’s data directory with.\nmkdir /&lt;path&gt;/&lt;to&gt;/git-github\n\n9.6.1 git clone\nFirst, we will learn to clone a remote repository onto our local machine.\nThis is actually not in our basic workflow diagram in Figure 9.1, however we only need to do it once, and is only needed when we work with a remote server. With clone we are making a copy of the remote repository, and linking it so we can transmit data between the copy on the ‘local’ machine with the ‘remote’ repository on the server.\nTo make the ‘copy’, navigate to our new repo, select the green code dropdown button (Figure 9.5), select SSH, and copy the address as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.5: Screenshot of the GitHub repository interface with the green ‘code’ drop down button pressed, and the menu showing the ‘clone’ information for SSH cloning (i.e., the copyable SSH address)\n\n\n\nBack at our command line, clone the repo as follows.\ngit clone git@github.com:&lt;YOUR_USERNAME&gt;/&lt;YOUR_REPO_NAME&gt;.git\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIt’s important that select the ssh tab, otherwise we will not be able to push and pull with our ssh keys! If we get asked for a password, we’ve not used ssh! Press ctrl + c, to cancel, and try the command again but with the correct ssh address.\n\n\nOnce cloned, we can run ls to see there is now a directory with the same name as repository.\nls\nIf we change into it and run ls again, we should see the README.md file we specified to be generated on GitHub.\ncd &lt;NAME_OF_REPO&gt;\nls\n\n\n9.6.2 git add\nNext, let’s add a new and modified file to our ‘staging area’ on our local machine.\nThis corresponds either to the red arrow or blue arrows in (Figure 9.6).\nWe can do this in two ways\n\nStage a previously untracked file\nStage a tracked, but now modified file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.6: Overview of basic operations when using git (following Figure 9.1) but with the command git add operations highlighted . The arrows indicating the two ‘staging’ operations, carried out by the git add command, are coloured red for a staging a ‘previously untracked’, and blue for the editing of an already tracked file and staging of the edited file. Reconstructed and modified after Chacon and Straub (2014).\n\n\n\nFirst we will make a new file called file_A.txt, and also add some extra text to the end of the README.md file (i.e., just modify).\nOnce we’ve made those both, lets first only stage the new file.\necho \"test_file\" &gt; file_A.txt\necho \"Just an example repo\" &gt;&gt; README.md\ngit add file_A.txt\n\n\n9.6.3 git status\nSo hopefully we’ve staged at least one file, but how do we know exactly what the status is of the modified and unmodified files in the repository?\nAt any point we can use the command git status to give a summary of any files present in the repository directory that changed status since the last commit (i.e., the last preserved entry in the git history).\ngit status\nOn branch main\nYour branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.\n\nChanges to be committed:\n  (use \"git restore --staged &lt;file&gt;...\" to unstage)\n    new file:   file_A.txt\n\nChanges not staged for commit:\n  (use \"git add &lt;file&gt;...\" to update what will be committed)\n  (use \"git restore &lt;file&gt;...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n    modified:   README.md\nWe should see that file_A.txt is staged and ‘ready to be committed’ but README.md is NOT staged - thus the changes would not be preserved to the git history. Comparing to our diagram in Figure 9.6, we have performed the ‘red’ arrow, but for the blue arrow, we’ve only carried out the ‘Edit file’ arrow, the second ‘Stage edited file’ is not yet carried out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nStage the modified README.md file and check the status again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\ngit add README.md\ngit status\nOn branch main\nYour branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.\n\nChanges to be committed:\n  (use \"git restore --staged &lt;file&gt;...\" to unstage)\n    modified:   README.md\n    new file:   file_A.txt\nWe should now see both README.md and file_A.txt coloured green, and in the ‘changes to be committed’ section. We can also see the README is ‘modified’ whereas file_A.txt is a new file, so will be newly indexed with git (i.e., will be the first entry in the git history for that file).\n\n\n\n\n\n9.6.4 git commit\nNow we need to package or save the changes into a commit with a message describing the changes we’ve just made. Each commit (i.e., entry in the git history) comes with a unique hash ID and will be stored forever in git history. Committing corresponds to the read arrow taking all staged modified or newly added files from the ‘Staged’ to ‘Unmodified state’ in (Figure 9.7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.7: Overview of basic operations when using git (following Figure 9.1) but with the command git commit operations highlighted. The red arrow shows committing the changes to history, i.e., taking a tracked file in the staging error, writing the modifications in the file to the git history and placing the file back into the ‘unmodified’ status column. Reconstructed and modified after Chacon and Straub (2014).\n\n\n\ngit commit -m \"Add new file and modify README\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe first time we commit, we may get a message about something like this.\nYour name and email address were configured automatically based\non your username and hostname. &lt;...&gt;\nFor the purposes of this tutorial this is fine, but it is highly recommended to follow the instructions in the message to correctly associate our commits to our GitHub account.\n\n\nThe -m part of the command corresponds to the human-readable description of the change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nWhat happens if we run git status again?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nOn branch main\nYour branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.\n  (use \"git push\" to publish your local commits)\n\nnothing to commit, working tree clean\nWe can see while there are no modified or staged files listed any more, our ‘branch’ is now ahead by 1 commit. This means that our local copy has an extra entry in the git history, compared to the remote server (‘origin’) copy of the repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n9.6.5 git push\nHow then do we ‘backup’ our local changes and the git history back up to the server?\nWe do that with, yes you guessed it, the git push command! This is the red dashed arrow in (Figure 9.8).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.8: Overview of basic operations when using git (following Figure 9.1) but with the command git push operations highlighted. The red dashed arrow between the local repository box of the local machine, to the remote repository on the server. This represents ‘pushing’ or sending the changes made on the local machine back up to remote repository, so both the local and remote repository have the same records of changes to the files. Reconstructed and modified after Chacon and Straub (2014).\n\n\n\nWe can run this as follows.\ngit push\nEnumerating objects: 6, done.\nCounting objects: 100% (6/6), done.\nDelta compression using up to 14 threads\nCompressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.\nWriting objects: 100% (4/4), 367 bytes | 367.00 KiB/s, done.\nTotal 4 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0\nTo github.com:&lt;USERNAME&gt;/&lt;REPOSITORY_NAME&gt;.git\n   536183b..2d252b5  main -&gt; main\nWhen we do this, we will get a bunch of lines including a set of progress information. Once we get a couple of hash strings, all our changes have been copied to the remote!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nWe mentioned earlier that as well as our human-readable commit ‘message’, we will also get a unique hash string for each commit. Where on the output are the commit hashes? What do you think the two hashes represent?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hash line is:\n   536183b..2d252b5  main -&gt; main\nThe two hashes represent the previous (536183b) entry in the git history, and the new one (2d252b5) of the one we just made when we ran git commit.\nTip: try typing git log!\nThe main bit of the string represents the branch we pushed to. We will learn more about this later in this chapter.\n\n\n\nIf we go to our GitHub repository on the website, and refresh the page, we should see the changes - both the file in the file browser at the top, and the new text we added to the README.md file!\n\n\n9.6.6 git pull\nBut what if we worked on a different local machine, and pushed changes from there? How do we the download new commits from our remote to our local repository?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.9: Overview of basic operations when using git (following Figure 9.1) but with the command git pull operations highlighted. The red dashed arrow going from the remote repository on the server back to the local repository represents copying changes pushed from elsewhere back to our local copy of the repository. Reconstructed and modified after Chacon and Straub (2014).\n\n\n\nWe carry this out with the counterpart of push, pull (Figure 9.9)! Try running the command now!\ngit pull\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nWhat output do we get from running git pull? Why does it say what it says?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nWe should get a message of Already up to date. This is because we have made no further changes to the remote version of the repository since we pushed!\n\n\n\nSo how can we make changes to the remote repository? One way would be to make a local clone elsewhere on a difference machine (or in a different folder on the same machine!), make some changes and commits there, and then push from there, and pull to our current local repository…\nBut that sounds rather convoluted, no 😉?\nInstead, another benefit of GitHub is we can actually make changes to our repository from our web browser! In our web browser, in the file browser, click on the README.md. If we’re still logged into our GitHub account, we should see a small pencil icon in the top right of the file viewer (Figure 9.10).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.10: Screenshot of a GitHub file viewer of a README.md file, with the pen ‘edit’ icon in the top right hand corner\n\n\n\nAfter pressing the pencil icon, add some more contents to the README.md file, then press the green ‘Commit changes’ button in the top right, write a commit message (sounds familiar?), and press the next ‘green ’Commit changes’ button (we can ignore the extended description).\nOn the resulting file browser, we should see our changes, and our commit message above the file browser with the commit hash!\nMoving back to our terminal, try running git pull again. This time we should get a bunch of progress bars and statistics again\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nWhat do you think the number next to the pulled file name means? What do the two colours represent?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number represents the number of lines with changes on them. The green plus and red minus symbol represents number lines with ‘additions’ modifications, and deletion modifications accordingly!\nA description of the changes is seen in the last line of the git pull output.\n\n\n\n\n\n9.6.7 Summary\nAnd that’s the basic 6 commands you need to know to work with Git and GitHub for our own work - repeat ad nauseum!\nGit is supremely powerful, but can get extremely complicated because of this. If we stick with these 6 commands to begin, and as you slowly get more comfortable with the routine, we recommend to start step-by-step broadening our git knowledge as you come across other questions and problems with git. There is no one comprehensive course or documentation, so we recommend just keep practising!",

    "section": "9.7 Working in sandboxes and collaboratively",
    "text": "9.7 Working in sandboxes and collaboratively\nOnce we’re comfortable with working Git for our own projects, it’s time to learn a few more things to help us work both more safely, efficiently, and also eventually collaboratively!\nGit facilitates ‘sandboxes’ potential changes and also simultaneous work by small teams through branching and pull requests.\nBranching generates an independent copy of the ‘mainline’ repository contents. When working on this branch, we can make as many changes and edits as we wish without breaking or modifying the ‘master’ version.\nOnce we’re happy with the changes we’ve made in our branch acting as the ‘sandbox’, we can then incorporate these changes into our ‘mainline’ repository using a pull request and a merge.\nWe can make a branch from any point in our git history, and also make as many branches as we want!\n\n9.7.1 Branches\nThere are two ways we can make a branch. The first way is using the GitHub interface, as in Figure 9.11.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.11: Three panel screenshot of GitHub interface for switching and creating branches. Panel A: A dropdown menu appears when we press ‘main’ (or the name of the current branch). Panel B: A search bar in the dropdown allows us to search for existing branches which appears in the search results. If no branch with that name exists, the search results presents a button saying ‘Create branch  from ’main’. Panel C: Once the new branch is made, we are returned to the repository file or file browser, but with the name on the dropdown listing the name of the new branch we made.\n\n\n\nThe instructions in Figure 9.11 would result in the branch existing on the remote copy of our repository i.e., on GitHub. To get this branch on our local copy, we can simply run git pull in our terminal!\nWe can also create branches via command line.\nFrom our terminal, we can create a new branch as follows.\ngit switch -c test-branch\nSwitched to a new branch 'test-branch'\nThe -c flag indicates to create the new branch with the name we provide, in the example above this is test-branch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nEarlier versions of git used a command called git checkout. Often we will see this command on many older tutorials. However git switch was created as a simpler and more intuitive command. git checkout is much more powerful command, but with great power comes great responsibility (and the risk to break things…)\n\n\nTo switch back to the original main branch we were on, run the same command but without the -c flag and with the name of the branch we switch to.\ngit switch main\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nNote that if we start making changes on one branch we must commit changes for them to be saved to the desired branch, before we switch to a new branch!\nUncommitted changes will ‘follow’ we to which ever branch we are on until make a commit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBonus Question\n\n\n\nWhat command could we run to see which branches already exist in the local repository we are on? This command has not been introduced in this tutorial! Try running\ngit --help\nor Google it to find the answer!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\ngit branch\n  main\n* test-branch\nWhere the green colour and the star indicates the branch we are currently on.\n\n\n\n\n\n9.7.2 Pull requests\nA Pull request (a.k.a. PR) is the GitHub term for proposing changes to a branch from another branch.\nOthers can comment and make suggestions before our changes are merged into the main branch.\nA pull request is the safest way to check our changes before we merge them in, and to ensure we don’t make any mistakes breaking something else in our ‘receiving’ branch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nGit(Hub) will tell and warn us if we are proposing changes on a line where since we branched, someone else has modified that line in the ‘receiving’ branch.\nThis is called a merge conflict, and is up to us to decide which is the correct change to retain.\n\n\nTo make a pull request, we first make sure we have a branch with some changes on it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nOn our local repository, in our terminal, switch back to our test-branch, and add another new line to the end of README.md, stage the file, commit, and push. (If we get stuck, or unsure, feel free to check the Answer).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst change to the branch.\ngit switch test-branch\nSwitched to branch 'test-branch'\nMake the edit.\necho 'We love SPAAM!' &gt;&gt; README.md\ngit status\nSwitched to branch 'test-branch'\nAdd and commit the change to git history.\ngit add README.md\ngit commit -m 'Update README'\n[test-branch 99c4266] Update README\n 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)\nPush the changes to the remote version of the repository.\ngit push\nfatal: The current branch test-branch has no upstream branch.\nTo push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use\n\n    git push --set-upstream origin test-branch\n\nIn this case, our remote copy of the repository does not have the branch. Therefore the first time we push, we tell Git to tell GitHub to create the branch on the remote as well by using the command it suggests.\ngit push --set-upstream origin test-branch\nEnumerating objects: 5, done.\nCounting objects: 100% (5/5), done.\nDelta compression using up to 14 threads\nCompressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.\nWriting objects: 100% (3/3), 352 bytes | 352.00 KiB/s, done.\nTotal 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0\nremote: \nremote: Create a pull request for 'test-branch' on GitHub by visiting:\nremote:      https://github.com/&lt;USERNAME&gt;/&lt;REPOSITORY_NAME&gt;/pull/new/test-branch\nremote: \nTo github.com:&lt;USERNAME&gt;/&lt;REPOSITORY_NAME&gt;.git\n * [new branch]      test-branch -&gt; test-branch\nBranch 'test-branch' set up to track remote branch 'test-branch' from 'origin\n\n\n\nOnce we’ve pushed our changes to our test-branch branch, go to the GitHub interface for the repository.\nOpen the ‘Pull requests tab’ and press the green ‘New pull request’ button, or press the green ‘Compare & pull request’ button in the yellow box that may appear if we recently pushed (Figure 9.12).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.12: Screenshot of GitHub pull requests tab, with green button for ‘New pull request’ and a yellow message saying a branch had recent pushes and another green button next to it saying ‘Compare & pull request’.\n\n\n\nOnce opened, we can add a title and a description of the pull request (Figure 9.13).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.13: Screenshot of the opening a pull request page, with two text boxes for adding a title, a longer description, and a green ‘Create pull request’ button at the bottom.\n\n\n\nOnce we press the Create pull request button, it’ll open the unique Pull request of this branch, in which others can leave comments and suggestions (Figure 9.14). By pressing the ‘Files changed’ tab, we can see exactly what has changed (Figure 9.15).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.14: Example screenshot of conversations tab of an open GitHub pull request, with the title, multiple tabs (Conversation, commits, checks, and file changed), an empty description box, and a comment box at the bottom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.15: Example screenshot of files tab of an open GitHub pull request with a text file of README.md being displayed.

Strains within any microbial species may have different genetic content and therefore may behave strikingly differently in the same environment, which cannot be determined through taxonomic profiling. Functionally profiling a microbial community, or determining all of the genes present independent of the species they are derived from, reveals the biochemical reactions and metabolic products the community may perform and produce, respectively.\nThis approach may provide insights to community activity and environmental interactions that are hidden when using taxonomic approaches alone.

    "text": "10.1 Introduction\nIn this chapter, we’re going to look at taxonomic profiling, or in other words, how to get the microbial composition of a sample from the DNA sequencing data.\nThough there are many algorithms, and even more different tools available to perform taxonomic profiling, the general idea remains the same (Figure 10.1).\nAfter cleaning up the sequencing data, generally saved as FASTQ files, a taxonomic profiler is used to compare the sequenced DNA to a reference database of sequences from known organisms, in order to generate a taxonomic profile of all organisms identified in a sample (Figure 10.1)\nIf you prefer text instead of pictograms, the workflow we’re going to cover today is outlined in Figure 10.2, adapted from Sharpton (2014)\nBecause different organisms can possess the same DNA, especially when looking at shorter sequences, taxonomic profilers need to have a way to resolve the ambiguity in the taxonomic assignation (Figure 10.3).\nBy leveraging an algorithm known as the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA), and the taxonomic tree of all known species, ambiguities are going to be resolved by assigning a higher, less precise, taxonomic rank to ambiguous matches (Figure 10.4).",

Furthermore, because the quality of the sequencing is not always optimal, we need to remove bases of lower sequencing quality to might lead to spurious results in downstream analyses.\nTo perform both of these tasks, we’ll use the program fastp (https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp) by Chen et al. (2018).\nThe following command gets you the help of fastp (the --help option is a common option in command-line tools that displays a list of available options and their descriptions).\n#| eval: false\nfastp -h\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see command output\n\n\n\n\n\noption needs value: --html\nusage: fastp [options] ...\noptions:\n  -i, --in1                            read1 input file name (string [=])\n  -o, --out1                           read1 output file name (string [=])\n  -I, --in2                            read2 input file name (string [=])\n  -O, --out2                           read2 output file name (string [=])\n      --unpaired1                      for PE input, if read1 passed QC but read2 not, it will be written to unpaired1.\n                                       Default is to discard it.

This correspond to the default analysis type (-t rel_ab).\n\n*  Profiling a metagenome from raw reads:\n$ metaphlan metagenome.fastq --input_type fastq -o profiled_metagenome.txt\n\n*  You can take advantage of multiple CPUs and save the intermediate BowTie2 output for re-running\n   MetaPhlAn extremely quickly:\n$ metaphlan metagenome.fastq --bowtie2out metagenome.bowtie2.bz2 --nproc 5 --input_type fastq -o profiled_metagenome.txt\n\n*  If you already mapped your metagenome against the marker DB (using a previous MetaPhlAn run), you\n   can obtain the results in few seconds by using the previously saved --bowtie2out file and\n   specifying the input (--input_type bowtie2out):\n$ metaphlan metagenome.bowtie2.bz2 --nproc 5 --input_type bowtie2out -o profiled_metagenome.txt\n\n*  bowtie2out files generated with MetaPhlAn versions below 3 are not compatibile.\n   Starting from MetaPhlAn 3.0, the BowTie2 ouput now includes the size of the profiled metagenome and the average read length.\n   If you want to re-run MetaPhlAn using these file you should provide the metagenome s via --nreads:\n$ metaphlan metagenome.bowtie2.bz2 --nproc 5 --input_type bowtie2out --nreads 520000 -o profiled_metagenome.txt\n\n*  You can also provide an externally BowTie2-mapped SAM if you specify this format with\n   --input_type. Two steps: first apply BowTie2 and then feed MetaPhlAn with the obtained sam:\n$ bowtie2 --sam-no-hd --sam-no-sq --no-unal --very-sensitive -S metagenome.sam -x \\\n  ${mpa_dir}/metaphlan_databases/mpa_v30_CHOCOPhlAn_201901 -U metagenome.fastq\n$ metaphlan metagenome.sam --input_type sam -o profiled_metagenome.txt\n\n*  We can also natively handle paired-end metagenomes, and, more generally, metagenomes stored in\n  multiple files (but you need to specify the --bowtie2out parameter):\n$ metaphlan metagenome_1.fastq,metagenome_2.fastq --bowtie2out metagenome.bowtie2.bz2 --nproc 5 --input_type fastq\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n========== Marker level analysis ============================\n\nMetaPhlAn introduces the capability of characterizing organisms at the strain level using non\naggregated marker information. Such capability comes with several slightly different flavours and\nare a way to perform strain tracking and comparison across multiple samples.\nUsually, MetaPhlAn is first ran with the default -t to profile the species present in\nthe community, and then a strain-level profiling can be performed to zoom-in into specific species\nof interest. This operation can be performed quickly as it exploits the --bowtie2out intermediate\nfile saved during the execution of the default analysis type.\n\n*  The following command will output the abundance of each marker with a RPK (reads per kilo-base)\n   higher 0.0. (we are assuming that metagenome_outfmt.bz2 has been generated before as\n   shown above).\n$ metaphlan -t marker_ab_table metagenome_outfmt.bz2 --input_type bowtie2out -o marker_abundance_table.txt\n   The obtained RPK can be optionally normald by the total number of reads in the metagenome\n   to guarantee fair comparisons of abundances across samples. The number of reads in the metagenome\n   needs to be passed with the '--nreads' argument\n\n*  The list of markers present in the sample can be obtained with '-t marker_pres_table'\n$ metaphlan -t marker_pres_table metagenome_outfmt.bz2 --input_type bowtie2out -o marker_abundance_table.txt\n   The --pres_th argument (default 1.0) set the minimum RPK value to consider a marker present\n\n*  The list '-t clade_profiles' analysis type reports the same information of '-t marker_ab_table'\n   but the markers are reported on a clade-by-clade basis.\n$ metaphlan -t clade_profiles metagenome_outfmt.bz2 --input_type bowtie2out -o marker_abundance_table.txt\n\n*  Finally, to obtain all markers present for a specific clade and all its subclades, the\n   '-t clade_specific_strain_tracker' should be used. For example, the following command\n   is reporting the presence/absence of the markers for the B. fragilis species and its strains\n   the optional argument --min_ab specifies the minimum clade abundance for reporting the markers\n\n$ metaphlan -t clade_specific_strain_tracker --clade s__Bacteroides_fragilis metagenome_outfmt.bz2 --input_typ\n  bowtie2out -o marker_abundance_table.txt\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\npositional arguments:\n  INPUT_FILE            the input file can be:\n                        * a fastq file containing metagenomic reads\n                        OR\n                        * a BowTie2 produced SAM file.\n                        OR\n                        * an intermediary mapping file of the metagenome generated by a previous MetaPhlAn run\n                        If the input file is missing, the script assumes that the input is provided using the standard\n                        input, or named pipes.\n                        IMPORTANT: the type of input needs to be specified with --input_type\n  OUTPUT_FILE           the tab-separated output file of the predicted taxon relative abundances\n                        [stdout if not present]\n\nRequired arguments:\n  --input_type {fastq,fasta,bowtie2out,sam}\n                        set whether the input is the FASTA file of metagenomic reads or\n                        the SAM file of the mapping of the reads against the MetaPhlAn db.\n\nMapping arguments:\n  --force               Force profiling of the input file by removing the bowtie2out file\n  --bowtie2db METAPHLAN_BOWTIE2_DB\n                        Folder containing the MetaPhlAn database.

(Brian D. Ondov, Bergman, and Phillippy 2011b) is a software tool for interactive visualization of hierarchical data, such as taxonomic profiles generated by metagenomics tools like MetaPhlAn. Krona allows users to explore the taxonomic composition of microbial communities in a hierarchical manner, from the highest taxonomic level down to the species level.\nThe metaphlan2krona.py script is used to convert the MetaPhlAn taxonomic profile output to a format that can be visualised by Krona. The output of the script is a text file that contains the taxonomic profile in a hierarchical format that can be read by Krona. The ktImportText command is then used to generate an interactive HTML file that displays the taxonomic profile in a hierarchical manner using Krona.\n#| eval: false\n\npython ../scripts/metaphlan2krona.py -p ../results/metaphlan/ERR5766177.metaphlan_profile.txt -k ../results/krona/ERR5766177_krona.out\nktImportText -o ../results/krona/ERR5766177_krona.html ../results/krona/ERR5766177_krona.out\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to see command output\n\n\n\n\n\nWriting ../results/krona/ERR5766177_krona.html...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nWhich proportion of the Firmicutes is made of Clostridiales ?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Clostridiales represent 63% of the Firmicutes in this sample.

    "text": "11.1 Introduction\nFirst of all, what is a metagenomic sample? Metagenomic sample is a sample that consists of DNA from more than one source. The number and the type of sources might vary widely between different samples. Typical sources for ancient remains are e.g. the host organism and the microbial species. The important part is that we generally do not know the origin of a DNA molecule prior to analysing the sequencing data generated from the DNA library of this sample. In the example presented in (Figure 11.1), our metagenomic sample has DNA from three different sources, here coloured in blue, red, and yellow.\nHow can we determine the sources of the DNA that we have in our metagenomic sample? There are three main options whose pros and cons are summarised in (Table 11.1).\nTable 11.1: Pros and cons of the major methods for determining the sources of metagenomic DNA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmethod\npros\ncons\n\n\n\n\nreference-based alignment\nhighly sensitive, applicable to aDNA samples\nrequires all sources to be represented in database\n\n\nsingle-genome assembly\nhigh-quality genomes from cultivated bacteria\nnot available for ancient DNA samples\n\n\nmetagenome assembly\nable to recover unknown diversity present in sample\nhighly dependent on preservation of ancient DNA\nUntil recently, the only option for ancient DNA samples was to take the short-read sequencing data and align them against some known reference genomes. However, this approach is heavily relying on whether all sources of our samples are represented in the available reference genomes. If a source is missing in the reference database - in our toy example, this is the case for the yellow source (Figure 11.1) -, then we won’t be able to detect it using this reference database.\nWhile there is a potential workaround for modern metagenomic samples, single-genome assembly relies on being able to cultivate a microbial species to obtain an isolate. This is unfeasible for ancient metagenomic samples because there are no more viable microbial cells available that could be cultivated.\nAround 2015, a technical revolution started when the first programs, e.g. MEGAHIT (Li et al. 2015) and metaSPAdes (Nurk et al. 2017), were published that could successfully perform de novo assembly from metagenomic data. Since then, tens of thousands metagenomic samples have been assembled and it was revealed that even well studied environments, such as the human gut microbiome, have a lot of additional microbial diversity that has not been observed previously via culturing and isolation (Almeida et al. 2021).\nThe technical advancement of being able to perform de novo assembly on metagenomic samples led to an explosion of studies that analysed samples that were considered almost impossible to study beforehand. For researchers that are exposed to ancient DNA, the imminent question arises: can we apply the same methods to ancient DNA data? In this practical course, we will walk through all required steps that are necessary to successfully perform de novo assembly from ancient DNA metagenomic sequencing data and show you what you can do once you have obtained the data.",

    "text": "11.3 Preparing the sequencing data for de novo assembly\nBefore running the actual assembly, we need to pre-process our sequencing data. Typical pre-processing steps include the trimming of adapter sequences and barcodes from the sequencing data and the removal of host or contaminant sequences, such as the bacteriophage PhiX, which is commonly sequenced as a quality control.\nMany assembly pipelines, such as nf-core/mag, have these steps automatically included, however, these steps can be performed prior to it, too. For this practical course, I have performed these steps for us and we could directly continue with the de novo assembly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe characteristic of ancient DNA samples that pre-determines the success of the de novo assembly is the distribution of the DNA molecule length. Determine this distribution prior to running the de novo assembly to be able to predict the results of the de novo assembly.\n\n\nHowever, since the average length of the insert size of sequencing data (Figure 11.3) is highly correlated with the success of the assembly, we want to first evaluate it. For this we can make use of the program fastp (Chen et al. 2018).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.3: Scheme of a read pair of Illumina sequencing data.\n\n\n\nFastp will try to overlap the two mates of a read pair and, if this is possible, return the length of the merged sequence, which is identical to insert size or the DNA molecule length. If the two mates cannot be overlapped, we will not be able to know the exact DNA molecule length but only know that it is longer than 290 bp (each read has a length of 150 bp and FastP requires a 11 bp overlap between the reads).\nThe final histogram of the insert sizes that is returned by FastP can tell us how well preserved the DNA of an ancient sample is (Figure 11.4). The more the distribution is skewed to the right, i.e. the longer the DNA molecules are, the more likely we are to obtain long contiguous DNA sequences from the de novo assembly. A distribution that is skewed to the left means that the DNA molecules are more highly degraded and this lowers our chances for obtaining long continuous sequences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.4: Example of a DNA molecule length distribution of a well-preserved ancient DNA sample. This histogram belongs to a 700,000-year-old horse that was preserved in permafrost, as reported in Orlando et al. (2013), Fig. S4.\n\n\n\nTo infer the distribution of the DNA molecules, we can run the command\n#| eval: false\nfastp --in1 2612_R1.fastq.gz \\\n      --in2 2612_R2.fastq.gz \\\n      --stdout --merge -A -G -Q -L --json /dev/null --html overlaps.html \\\n&gt; /dev/null\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nInfer the distribution of the DNA molecule length of the sequencing data. Is this sample well-preserved?\nHint: You can easily inspect the distribution by opening the HTML report overlaps.html in your web browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is the histogram of the insert sizes determined by fastp (Figure 11.5). By default, fastp will only keep reads that are longer than 30 bp and requires an overlap between the read mates of 30 bp. The maximum read length is 150 bp, therefore, the histogram only spreads from 31 to 271 bp in total.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.5: Histogram of the insert sizes determined by fastp\n\n\n\nThe sequencing data for the sample 2612 were generated across eight different sequencing runs, which differed in their nominal length. Some sequencing runs were 2x 100 bp, while others were 2x 150 bp. This is the reason why we observe two peaks just short of 100 and 150 bp. The difference to the nominal length is caused by the quality trimming of the data.\nOverall, we have almost no short DNA molecules (&lt; 50 bp) but most DNA molecules are longer than 80 bp. Additionally, there were &gt; 200,000 read pairs that could not be overlapped. Therefore, we can conclude that the sample 2612 is moderately degraded ancient DNA sample and has many long DNA molecules.",

    "text": "11.4 De novo assembly\nNow, we will actual perform the de novo assembly on the sequencing data. For this, we will use the program MEGAHIT (Li et al. 2015), a de Bruijn-graph assembler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.6: Overview of inferring k-mers from a DNA sequence. Credit: https://medium.com/swlh/bioinformatics-1-k-mer-counting-8c1283a07e29\n\n\n\nDe Bruijn graph assemblers are together with overlap assemblers the predominant group of assemblers. They use k-mers (see Figure 11.6 for an example of 4-mers) extracted from the short-read sequencing data to build the graph. For this, they connect each k-mer to adjacent k-mer using a directional edge. By walking along the edges and visiting each k-mer or node once, longer continuous sequences are reconstructed. This is a very rough explanation and I would advise you to watch this excerpt of a lecture by Rob Edwards from San Diego State University and a Coursera lecture by Ben Langmead from Johns Hopkins University, if you would like to learn more about it.\nAll de Bruijn graph assemblers work in a similar way so the question is why do we use MEGAHIT and not other programs, such as metaSPAdes?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPros and cons of MEGAHIT\n\n\n\nPros:\n\nlow-memory footprint: can be run on computational infrastructure that does not have large memory resources\ncan assembly both single-end and paired-end sequencing data\nthe assembly algorithm can cope with the presence of high amounts of ancient DNA damage\n\nCons:\n\nlower assembly quality on modern comparative data, particularly a higher rate of mis-assemblies (CAMI II challenge)\n\n\n\nIn the Warinner group, we realised after some tests that MEGAHIT has a clear advantage when ancient DNA damage is present at higher quantities. While it produced a higher number of mis-assemblies compared to metaSPAdes when being evaluated on simulated modern metagenomic data (Critical Assessment of Metagenome Interpretation II challenge, Meyer et al. 2022), it produces more long contigs when ancient DNA damage is present.\nTo de novo assemble the short-read sequencing data of the sample 2612 using MEGAHIT, we can run the command\n#| eval: false\nmegahit -1 2612_R1.fastq.gz \\\n        -2 2612_R2.fastq.gz \\\n        -t 14 --min-contig-len 500 \\\n        --out-dir megahit\nThis will use the paired-end sequencing data as input and return all contigs that are at least 500 bp long.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nWhile MEGAHIT is able to use merged sequencing data, it is advised to use the unmerged paired-end data as input. In tests using simulated data I have observed that MEGAHIT performed slightly better when using the unmerged data and it likely has something to do with its internal algorithm to infer insert sizes from the paired-end data.\n\n\nWhile we are waiting for MEGAHIT to finish, here is a question:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nWhich k-mer lengths did MEGAHIT select for the de novo assembly?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the maximum read length, MEGAHIT decided to use the k-mer lengths of 21, 29, 39, 59, 79, 99, 119, and 141.\n\n\n\nNow, as MEGAHIT has finished, we want to evaluate the quality of the assembly results. MEGAHIT has written the contiguous sequences (contigs) into a single FastA file stored in the folder megahit.\nWe will process this FastA file with a small script from Heng Li (creator of the famous bwa aligner among others), calN50, which will count the number of contigs and give us an overview of their length distribution.\nThe script is already present in the chapter’s directory.\n#| eval: false\nk8 ./calN50.js megahit/final.contigs.fa\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nHow many contigs were assembled? What is the sum of the lengths of all contigs? What is the maximum, the median, and the minimum contig length?\nHint: The maximum contig length is indicated by the label “N0”, the median by the label “N50”, and the minimum by the label “N100”?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nMEGAHIT assembled 3,606 contigs and their lengths sum up to 11.4 Mb. The maximum contig length was 448 kb, the median length was 15.6 kb, and the minimum length was 500 bp.\n\n\n\nThere is a final caveat when assembling ancient metagenomic data with MEGAHIT: while it is able to assemble sequencing data with a high percentage of C-to-T substitutions, it tends to introduce these changes into the contig sequences, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.7: De Bruijn graph with a bubble caused by a second allele. Adapted from (Leggett et al. 2013, fig. 1a)\n\n\n\nThese C-to-T substitutions are similar to biological single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the sequencing data. Both lead the introduction of bubbles in the de Bruijn graph when two alleles are present in the k-mer sequences (Figure 11.7) and the assembler decides during its pruning steps which allele to keep in the contig sequence.\nWhile it does not really matter which allele is kept for biological polymorphisms, it does matter for technical artefacts that are introduced by the presence of ancient DNA damage. In our group we realised that the gene sequences that were annotated on the contigs of MEGAHIT tended to have a higher number of nonsense mutations compared to the known variants of the genes. After manual inspection, we observed that many of these mutations appeared because MEGAHIT chose the damage-derived T allele over the C allele or the damage-derived A allele over a G allele (see Klapper et al. 2023, fig. S1).\nTo overcome this issue, my colleagues Maxime Borry, James Fellows Yates and I developed a strategy to replace these damage-derived alleles in the contig sequences. This approach consists of aligning the short-read data against the contigs, performing genotyping along them, and finally replacing all alleles for which we have strong support for an allele that is different from the one selected by MEGAHIT.\nWe standardised this approach and added it to the Nextflow pipeline nf-core/mag (Krakau et al. 2022). It can simply be activated by providing the parameter --ancient_dna.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nWhile MEGAHIT is able to assemble ancient metagenomic sequencing data with high amounts of ancient DNA damage, it tends to introduce damage-derived T and A alleles into the contig sequences instead of the true C and G alleles. This can lead to a higher number of nonsense mutations in coding sequences. We strongly advise you to correct such mutations, e.g. by using the ancient DNA workflow of the Nextflow pipeline nf-core/mag.",

The alignment is rather slow because we allow a single mismatch in the seeds that are used by the aligner BowTie2 to quickly determine the position of a read along the contig sequences (parameter -N 1). This is necessary because otherwise we might not be able to align reads with ancient DNA damage present on them. Secondly, the larger the resulting alignment file is the longer it takes to sort it by coordinate.\nTo save us some time and continue with the more interesting analyses, I prepared the resulting files for us. For this, I also corrected damage-derived alleles in the contig sequences. You can access these files on the cluster by running the following commands:\n#| eval: false\nmkdir alignment\nln -s /&lt;PATH&gt;/&lt;TO&gt;/denovo-assembly/seqdata_files/2612.sorted.calmd.bam alignment/\nln -s /&lt;PATH&gt;/&lt;TO&gt;/denovo-assembly/seqdata_files/2612.sorted.calmd.bam.bai alignment/\nln -s /&lt;PATH&gt;/&lt;TO&gt;/denovo-assembly/seqdata_files/2612.fa alignment/\nIf we wanted to generate the alignments ourselves, we can check the commands in the box below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManual alignment with Bowtie2\n\n\n\n\n\nTo execute the alignment step ourselves we could theoretically run the following commands:\n#| eval: false\nmkdir alignment\nbowtie2-build -f megahit/final.contigs.fa alignment/2612\nbowtie2 -p 14 --very-sensitive -N 1 -x alignment/2612 -1 2612_R1.fastq.gz -2 2612_R2.fastq.gz | \\\nsamtools view -Sb - | \\\nsamtools calmd -u /dev/stdin megahit/final.contigs.fa | \\\nsamtools sort -o alignment/2612.sorted.calmd.bam -\nsamtools index alignment/2612.sorted.calmd.bam",

    "section": "11.6 Reconstructing metagenome-assembled genomes",
    "text": "11.6 Reconstructing metagenome-assembled genomes\nThere are typically two major approaches on how to study biological diversity of samples using the results obtained from the de novo assembly. The first one is to reconstruct metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and to study the species diversity.\n“Metagenome-assembled genome” is a convoluted term that means that we reconstructed a genome from metagenomic data via de novo assembly. While these reconstructed genomes, particularly the high-quality ones, are most likely a good representation of the genomes of the organisms present in the sample, the scientific community refrains from calling them a species or a strain. The reason is that for calling a genome a species or a strain additional analyses would be necessary, of which many would include the cultivation of the organism. For many samples, this is not feasible and therefore the community stuck to the term MAG instead.\nThe most commonly applied method to obtain MAGs is the so-called “non-reference binning”. Non-reference binning means that we do not try to identify contigs by aligning them against known reference genomes, but only use the characteristics of the contigs themselves to cluster them (Figure 11.8).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.8: Scheme of binning de novo assembled contigs into metagenome-assembled genomes. During the binning contigs are grouped into clusters based on their characteristics, such as tetra-nucleotide frequency and the coverage along the contigs. Clusters of contigs that fulfil a minimum of quality criteria are then considered as metagenome-assembled genomes. However, depending on the sample, a number of contigs will remain unbinned.\n\n\n\nThe two most commonly used characteristics are:\n\nthe tetra-nucleotide frequency: the frequency of all 4-mers (e.g. AAAA, AAAC, AAAG etc.) in the contig sequence\nthe coverage along the contig\n\nThe idea here is that two contigs that are derived from the same bacterial genome will likely have a similar nucleotide composition and coverage.\nThis approach works very well when the contigs are longer and they strongly differ in the nucleotide composition and the coverage from each other. However, if this is not the case, e.g. there is more than one strain of the same species in the sample, these approaches will likely not be able to assign some contigs to clusters: these contigs remain unbinned. In case there is a high number of unbinned contigs, one can also employ the more sensitive reference-based binning strategies but we will not cover this in this practical course.\nThere are a number of different binning tools out there that can be used for this task. Since this number is constantly growing, there have been attempts to standardise the test data sets that these tools are run on so that their performances can be easily compared. The most well-known attempt is the Critical Assessment of Metagenome Interpretation (Critical Assessment of Metagenome Interpretation II challenge, Meyer et al. 2022), which released the latest comparison of commonly used tools for assembly, binning, and bin refinement in 2022. I recommend that you first check the performance of a new tool against the CAMI datasets before testing it to see whether it is worth using it.\nThree commonly used binners are:\n\nmetaBAT2 (Kang et al. 2019, more than 1,300 citations)\nMaxBin2 (Wu, Simmons, and Singer 2016, more than 1,200 citations)\nCONCOCT (Alneberg et al. 2014, more than 1,000 citation)\n\nEach of these three binners employs a slightly different strategy. While metaBAT2 simply uses the two previously mentioned metrics, the tetra-nucleotide frequency and the coverage along the contigs, MaxBin2 additionally uses single-copy marker genes to infer the taxonomic origin of contigs. In contrast, CONCOCT also just uses the two aforementioned metrics but first performs a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on these metrics and uses the PCA results for the clustering.\nThe easiest way to run all these three programs is the program metaWRAP (Uritskiy, DiRuggiero, and Taylor 2018). metaWRAP is in fact a pipeline that allows you to assemble your contigs, bin them, and subsequently refine the resulting MAGs. However, the pipeline is not very well written and does not contain any strategies to deal with ancient metagenomic sequencing data. Therefore, I prefer to use different pipelines, such as nf-core/mag for the assembly, and only use metaWRAP for binning and bin refinement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nMake sure you have followed the instructions for setting up the additional software requirements for this chapter already! See the beginning of the chapter for more information.\n\n\nTo skip the first steps of metaWRAP and start straight with the binning, we need to create the folder structure and files that metaWRAP expects:\n#| eval: false\nmkdir -p metawrap/INITIAL_BINNING/2612/work_files\nln -s $PWD/alignment/2612.sorted.calmd.bam \\\n    metawrap/INITIAL_BINNING/2612/work_files/2612.bam\nmkdir -p metawrap/faux_reads\necho \"@\" &gt; metawrap/faux_reads/2612_1.fastq\necho \"@\" &gt; metawrap/faux_reads/2612_2.fastq\nNow, we can start to run the binning. In this practical course, we will focus on metaBAT2 and MaxBin2. To bin the contigs with these binners, we execute:\n#| eval: false\nconda activate metawrap-env\nmetawrap binning -o metawrap/INITIAL_BINNING/2612 \\\n    -t 14 \\\n    -a alignment/2612.fa \\\n    --metabat2 --maxbin2 --universal \\\n    metawrap/faux_reads/2612_1.fastq metawrap/faux_reads/2612_2.fastq\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nMetaWRAP is not a well-written Python software and has not been update for more than three years. It still relies on the deprecated Python v2.7. This is in conflict with many other tools and therefore it requires its own conda environment, metawrap-env. Do not forget to deactivate this environment afterwards again!\n\n\nMetaWRAP will run metaBAT2 and MaxBin2 for us and store their respective output into sub-folders in the folder metawrap/INITIAL_BINNING/2612.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nHow many bins did metaBAT2 and MaxBin2 reconstruct, respectively? Is there a difference in the genome sizes of these reconstructed bins?\nHint: You can use the previously introduced script k8 ./calN50.js to analyse the genome size of the individual bins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nmetaBAT2 reconstructed seven bins, while MaxBin2 reconstructed only five bins.\nWhen comparing the genome sizes of these bins, we can see that despite having reconstructed fewer bins, MaxBin2’s bins have on average larger genome size and all of them are at least 1.5 Mb. In contrast, five out of seven metaBAT2 bins are shorter than 1.5 Mb.\n\n\n\nWhile we could have run these two binning softwares manually ourselves, there is another reason why we should use metaWRAP: it has a powerful bin refinement algorithm.\nAs we just observed, binning tools come to different results when performing non-reference binning on the same contigs. So how do we know which binning tool delivered the better or even correct results?\nA standard approach is to identify single-copy marker genes that are specific for certain taxonomic lineages, e.g. to all members of the family Prevotellaceae or to all members of the kingdom archaea. If we find lineage-specific marker genes from more than one lineage in our bin, something likely went wrong. While in certain cases horizontal gene transfer could explain such a finding, it is much more common that a binning tool clustered two contigs from two different taxons.\nDuring its bin refinement, metaWRAP first combines the results of all binning tools in all combinations. So it would merge the results of metaBAT2 and MaxBin2, metaBAT2 and CONCOCT, MaxBin2 and CONCOCT, and all three together. Afterwards, it evaluates the presence of lineage-specific marker genes on the contigs of the bins for every combination and the individual binning tools themselves. In the case that it would find marker genes of more than one lineage in a bin, it would split the bin into two. After having evaluated everything, metaWRAP selects the refined bins that have the highest quality score across the whole set of bins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.9: Performance of metaWRAP’s bin refinement algorithm compared to other tools. Adapted from Uritskiy, DiRuggiero, and Taylor (2018), Fig. 4\n\n\n\nUsing this approach, the authors of metaWRAP could show that they can outperform the individual binning tools and other bin refinement algorithms both regarding the completeness and contamination that was estimated for the MAGs (Figure 11.9).\nDue to the large memory requirements of the the bin refinment module, we have prepared the results of metaWRAP’s bin refinement algorithm, metawrap_50_10_bins.stats for you already, which can be found in the folder /&lt;PATH&gt;/&lt;TO&gt;/denovo-assembly/seqdata_files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nRunning metaWRAP’s bin refinement module requires about 72 GB of memory because it has to load a larger reference database containing the lineage-specific marker genes of checkM.\nIf you have sufficient computational memory resources, you can run the following steps to run the bin refinement yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample commands - do not run!\n\n\n\n\n\nTo apply metaWRAP’s bin refinement to the bins that we obtained from metaBAT2 and MaxBin2, we first need to install the software checkM (Parks et al. 2015) that will provide the lineage-specific marker gene catalogue:\n#| eval: false\n## Only run if you have at least 72 GB of memory!\nmkdir checkM\nwget -O checkM/checkm_data_2015_01_16.tar.gz \\\n    https://data.ace.uq.edu.au/public/CheckM_databases/checkm_data_2015_01_16.tar.gz\ntar xvf checkM/checkm_data_2015_01_16.tar.gz -C checkM\n\necho checkM | checkm data setRoot checkM\nAfterwards, we can execute metaWRAP’s bin refinement module:\n#| eval: false\n## Only run if you have at least 72 GB of memory!\nmkdir -p metawrap/BIN_REFINEMENT/2612\nmetawrap bin_refinement -o metawrap/BIN_REFINEMENT/2612 \\\n    -t 14 \\\n    -c 50 \\\n    -x 10 \\\n    -A metawrap/INITIAL_BINNING/2612/maxbin2_bins \\\n    -B metawrap/INITIAL_BINNING/2612/metabat2_bins\nOnce finished you can deactivate the metawrap conda environment.\n#| eval: false \nconda deactivate\n\n\n\nThe latter step will produce a summary file, metawrap_50_10_bins.stats, that lists all retained bins and some key characteristics, such as the genome size, the completeness estimate, and the contamination estimate. The latter two can be used to assign a quality score according to the Minimum Information for MAG (MIMAG; see info box).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Minimum Information for MAG (MIMAG)\n\n\n\nThe two most common metrics to evaluate the quality of MAGs are:\n\nthe completeness: how many of the expected lineage-specific single-copy marker genes were present in the MAG?\nthe contamination: how many of the expected lineage-specific single-copy marker genes were present more than once in the MAG?\n\nThese metric is usually calculated using the marker-gene catalogue of checkM (Parks et al. 2015), also if there are other estimates from other tools such as BUSCO (Manni et al. 2021), GUNC (Orakov et al. 2021) or checkM2 (Chklovski et al. 2022).\nDepending on the estimates on completeness and contamination plus the presence of RNA genes, MAGs are assigned to the quality category following the Minimum Information for MAG criteria (Bowers et al. 2017) You can find the overview here.\n\n\nAs these two steps will run rather long and need a large amount of memory and disk space, I have provided the results of metaWRAP’s bin refinement. You can find the file here: /&lt;PATH&gt;/&lt;TO&gt;/denovo-assembly/metawrap_50_10_bins.stats. Be aware that these results are based on the bin refinement of the results of three binning tools and include CONCOCT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nHow many bins were retained after the refinement with metaWRAP? How many high-quality and medium-quality MAGs did the refinement yield following the MIMAG criteria?\nHint: You can more easily visualise tables on the terminal using the Python program visidata. You can open a table using vd -f tsv /&lt;PATH&gt;/&lt;TO&gt;/denovo-assembly/metawrap_50_10_bins.stats. (press ctrl+q to exit). Next to separating the columns nicely, it allows you to perform a lot of operations like sorting conveniently. Check the cheat sheet here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nIn total, metaWRAP retained five bins, similarly to MaxBin2. Of these five bins, the bins bin.3 and bin.4 had completeness and contamination estimates that would qualify them for being high-quality MAGs. However, we would need to check the presence of rRNA and tRNA genes. The other three bins are medium-quality bins because their completeness estimate was &lt; 90%.",

Instead, it is sufficient to perform a sequence search against a reference database.\nThere are plenty of tools available for this task, such as:\n\nBLAST/DIAMOND\nKraken2\nCentrifuge\nMMSeqs2\n\nFor each tool, we can either use pre-computed reference databases or compute our own one. The two taxonomic classification systems that are most commonly used are:\n\nNCBI Taxonomy\nGTDB\n\nAs for any task that involves the alignment of sequences against a reference database, the chosen reference database should fit the sequences you are searching for. If your reference database does not capture the diversity of your samples, you will not be able to assign a subset of the contigs. There is also a trade-off between a large reference database that contains all sequences and its memory requirement. Wright, Comeau, and Langille (2023) elaborated on this quite extensively when comparing Kraken2 against MetaPhlAn.\nWhile all of these tools can do the job, I typically prefer to use the program MMSeqs2 (Steinegger and Söding 2017) because it comes along with a very fast algorithm based on amino acid sequence alignment and implements a lowest common ancestor (LCA) algorithm (Figure 11.10). Recently, they implemented a taxonomy workflow (Mirdita et al. 2021) that allows to efficiently assign contigs to taxons. Luckily, it comes with multiple pre-computed reference databases, such as the GTDB v207 reference database (Parks et al. 2020), and therefore it is even more accessible for users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.10: Scheme of the taxonomy workflow implemented into MMSeqs2.

    "text": "11.8 Taxonomic assignment of MAGs\nMMSeqs2’s taxonomy workflow is very useful to classify all contigs taxonomically. However, how would we determine which species we reconstructed by binning our contigs?\nThe simplest approach would be that we could summarise MMSeqs2’s taxonomic assignments of all contigs of a MAG and then determine which lineage is the most frequent one. Although this would work in general, there is another approach that is more sophisticated: GTDB toolkit (GTDBTK, Chaumeil et al. 2020).\nGTDBTK performs three steps to assign a MAG to a taxonomic lineage:\n\nLineage identification based on single-copy marker genes using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)\nMulti-sequence alignment of the identified marker genes\nPlacement of the MAG genome into a fixed reference tree at class level\n\nThe last step is particularly clever. Based on the known diversity of a lineage present in the GTDB, it will construct a reference tree with all known taxa of this lineage. Afterwards, the tree structure is fixed and an algorithm attempts to create a new branch in the tree for placing the unknown MAG based on both the tree structure and the multi-sequence alignment.\nIn most cases, both the simple approach of taking the majority of the MMSeqs2’s taxonomy results and the GTDBTK approach lead to very similar results. However, GTDBTK performs better when determining whether a new MAG potentially belongs to a new genus or even a new family.\nTo infer which taxa our five reconstructed MAGs represent, we can run the GTDBTK.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nThe latest version of the database used by GTDBTK (r207) requires about 70 GB of harddisk space and 80 GB of memory for running.\nTherefore for those on smaller computational infrastructure, I have pre-computed the results.

    "text": "11.9 Evaluating the amount of ancient DNA damage\nOne of the common questions that remain at this point of our analysis is whether the contigs that we assembled show evidence for the presence of ancient DNA damage. If yes, we could argue that these microbes are indeed ancient, particularly when their DNA fragment length distribution is rather short, too.\nMAGs typically consist of either tens or hundreds of contigs. For this case, many of the commonly used tools for quantifying the amount of ancient DNA damage, such as damageprofiler (Neukamm, Peltzer, and Nieselt 2021) or mapDamage2 (Jónsson et al. 2013), are not very well suited because they would require us to manually check each of their generated “smiley plots”, which visualise the amount of C-to-T substitutions at the end of reads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.11: Overview of the model comparison performed by pyDamage. The green line represents the null model, i.e. the absence of ancient DNA damage, while the orange line represents the alternative model, i.e. the presence of ancient DNA damage.\n\n\n\nInstead, we will use the program pyDamage (Borry et al. 2021) that was written with the particular use-case of metagenome-assembled contigs in mind. Although pyDamage can visualise the amount of C-to-T substitutions at the 5’ end of reads, it goes a step further and fits two models upon the substitution frequency (Figure 11.11). The null hypothesis is that the observed distribution of C-to-T substitutions at the 5’ end of reads reflects a flat line, i.e. a case when no ancient DNA damage is present. The alternative model assumes that the distribution resembles an exponential decay, i.e. a case when ancient DNA damage is present. By comparing the fit of these two models to the observed data for each contig, pyDamage can quickly identify contigs that are likely of ancient origin without requiring the user to inspect the plots visually.\nWe can run pyDamage directly on the alignment data in BAM format:\n#| eval: false\npydamage analyze -w 30 -p 14 alignment/2612.sorted.calmd.bam\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nEvaluate the pyDamage results with respect to the amount of C-to-T substitutions observed on the contigs! How many contigs does pyDamage consider to show evidence for ancient DNA damage? How much power (prediction accuracy) does it have for this decision? Which MAGs are strongly “ancient” or “modern”?\nHint: You can access pyDamage’s results easily by opening the file using visidata: vd pydamage_results/pydamage_results.csv (press ctrl + q to exit)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the 3,606 contigs, pyDamage inferred a q-value, i.e. a p-value corrected for multiple testing, of &lt; 0.5 to 26 contigs. This is partially due to a high fraction of the contigs with no sufficient information to discriminate between the models (predicted accuracy of &lt; 0.5). However, the majority of the contigs with a prediction accuracy of &gt; 0.5 still had q-values of 0.05 and higher. This suggests that overall the sample did not show large evidence of ancient DNA damage.\nThis reflects also on the MAGs. Although four of the five MAGs were human gut microbiome taxa, they did not show strong evidence of ancient DNA damage. This suggests that the sample is too young and is well preserved.",

    "text": "11.10 Annotating genomes for function\nThe second approach on how to study biological diversity of samples using the assembly results is to compare the reconstructed genes and their functions with each other.\nWhile it is very interesting to reconstruct the metagenome-assembled genomes from contigs and speculate about the evolution of a certain taxon, this does not always help when studying the ecology of a microbiome. Studying the ecology of a microbiome means to understand which taxa are present in an environment, what type of community do they form, what kind of natural products do they produce etc.?\nWith the lack of any data from culture isolates, it is rather difficult to discriminate from which species a reconstructed gene sequence is coming from, particularly when the contigs are short. Many microbial species exchange genes among each other via horizontal gene transfer which leads to multiple copies of a gene to be present in our metagenome and increases the level of difficulty further.\nBecause of this, many researchers tend to annotate all genes of a MAGs and compare the presence and absence of these genes across other genomes that were taxonomically assigned to the same taxon. This analysis, called pan-genome analysis, allows us to estimate the diversity of a microbial species with respect to their repertoire of protein-coding genes.\nOne of the most commonly used annotation tools for MAGs is Prokka (Seemann 2014), although it has recently been challenged by Bakta (Schwengers et al. 2021). The latter provides the same functionality as Prokka but incorporates more up-to-date reference databases for the annotation. Therefore, the scientific community is slowly shifting to Bakta.\nNext to returning information on the protein-coding genes, Prokka also returns the annotation of RNA genes (tRNAs and rRNAs), which will help us to evaluate the quality of MAGs regarding the MIMAG criteria.\nFor this practical course, we will use Prokka and we will focus on annotating the pre-refined MAG bin bin.3.fa that we reconstructed from the sample 2612.\n#| eval: false\nprokka --outdir prokka \\\n    --prefix 2612_003 \\\n    --compliant --metagenome --cpus 14 \\\n    seqdata_files/metawrap_50_10_bins/bin.3.fa\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you performed your own metaWRAP bin refineent, you would find the bin.3.fa in the metawrap/BIN_REFINEMENT directory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nProkka has annotated our MAG. What type of files does Prokka return? How many genes/tRNAs/rRNAs were detected?\nHint: Check the file prokka/2612_003.txt for the number of annotated elements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nProkka returns the following files:\n\n.faa: the amino acid sequences of all identified coding sequences\n.ffn: the nucleotide sequences of all identified coding sequences\n.fna: all contigs in nucleotide sequence format renamed following Prokka’s naming scheme\n.gbk: all annotations and sequences in GenBank format\n.gff: all annotations and sequences in GFF format\n.tsv: the tabular overview of all annotations\n.txt: the short summary of the annotation results\n\nProkka found 1,797 coding sequences, 32 tRNAs, but no rRNAs. Finding no rRNAs is a common issues when trying to assemble MAGs without long-read sequencing data and is not just characteristic for ancient DNA samples. However, this means that we cannot technically call this MAG a high-quality MAG due to the lack of the rRNA genes.",

    "text": "11.12 Summary\nIn this practical course you have gone through all the important steps that are necessary for de novo assembling ancient metagenomic sequencing data to obtain contiguous DNA sequences with little error. Furthermore, you have learned how to cluster these sequences into bins without using any references and how to refine them based on lineage-specific marker genes. For these refined bins, you have evaluated their quality regarding common standards set by the scientific community and assigned the MAGs to its most likely taxon. Finally, we learned how to infer the presence of ancient DNA damage and annotate them for RNA genes and protein-coding sequences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionary note - sequencing depth\n\n\n\nBe aware of the sequencing depth when you assemble your sample. This sample used in this practical course was not obtained by randomly subsampling but I subsampled the sample so that we are able to reconstruct MAGs.\nThe original sample had almost 200 million reads, however, I subsampled it to less than 5 million reads. You usually need a lot of sequencing data for de novo assembly and definitely more data than for reference-alignment based profiling. However, it also heavily depends on the complexity of the sample. So the best advice is: just give it a try!",

    "text": "12.3 Modern genomic hit validation criteria\nThe modern validation methods aim at confirming organism presence regardless of its ancient status. The main approaches include evenness / breadth of coverage computation, assessing alignment quality, and monitoring affinity of the DNA reads to the reference genome of the potential host.\n\n12.3.1 Depth vs breadth and evenness of coverage\nConcluding organism presence by relying solely on the numbers of assigned sequenced reads (aka depth of coverage metric) turns out to be not optimal and too permissive, which may result in a large amount of false-positive discoveries. For example, when using alignment to a reference genome, the mapped reads may demonstrate non-uniform coverage as visualized in the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.2: Screenshot of the IGV software. The reference genome bar is shown at the top, and in the main panel tall isolated ‘towers’ of reads with lots of coloured bases representing read ‘stacking’ i.e., un-uniform distribution of reads across the whole genome (as expected of the correct reference genome), but accumulation of all reads in the same isolated places on the reference genome, with the many variants on the reads suggesting they are from different species and aligning to conserved regions.\n\n\n\nIn this case, DNA reads originating from another microbe were (mis-)aligned to Yersina pestis reference genome. It can be observed that a large number the reads align only to a few conserved genomic loci. Therefore, even if many thousands of DNA reads are capable of aligning to the reference genome, the overall uneven alignment pattern suggests no presence of Yersina pestis in the metagenomic sample. Thus, not only the number of assigned reads (proportional to depth of coverage metric) but also the breadth and evenness of coverage metrics become of particular importance for verification of metagenomic findings, i.e. hits with DNA reads uniformly aligned across the reference genome are more likely to be true-positive detections (Figure 12.3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.3: Schematic diagram of the differences between a) read stacking (all reads aligned at one position fo the genome), indicating you’ve not correctly identified the organism, vs b) reads distributed across all the genome. A formula at the bottom of the image shows how both A and B have the same depth of coverage even though they have very different actual patterns on the genome.\n\n\n\nIn the next sections, we will show how to practically compute the breadth and evenness of coverage via KrakenUniq and Samtools.\n\n\n12.3.2 Breadth of coverage via KrakenUniq\nHere we are going to demonstrate that one can assess breadth of coverage information already at the taxonomic profiling step. Although taxonomic classifiers do not perform alignment, some of them, such as KrakenUniq and Kraken2 provide a way to infer breadth of coverage in addition to the number of assigned reads to a taxon. This allows for immediate filtering out a lot of false positive hits. Since Kraken-family classifiers are typically faster and less memory-demanding, i.e. can work with very large reference databases, compared to genome aligners, they provide a robust and fairly unbiased initial taxonomic profiling, which can still later be followed-up with proper alignment and computing evenness of coverage as described above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf guided: data preparation\n\n\n\n\n\n⚠️ This step will require large amounts of memory and CPUs!, so if running yourself please note this step is better suited for a server, HPC cluster, or the cloud rather than on a laptop!\nTo profile the data with KrakenUniq one needs a database, a pre-built complete microbial NCBI RefSeq database can be accessed via https://doi.org/10.17044/scilifelab.21299541.\nPlease use the following command line to download the database:\n#| eval: false\ncd krakenuniq/ ## If you've left it...\n\nwget https://figshare.scilifelab.se/ndownloader/articles/21299541/versions/1 \\\n&& unzip 1 && rm 1\nThe following example command is how you would execute KrakenUniq.\n#| eval: false\n\nfor i in $(ls *.trimmed.fastq.gz)\ndo\nkrakenuniq --db KRAKENUNIQ_DB --fastq-input $i --threads 20 \\\n--classified-out ${i}.classified_sequences.krakenuniq \\\n--unclassified-out ${i}.unclassified_sequences.krakenuniq \\\n--output ${i}.sequences.krakenuniq --report-file ${i}.krakenuniq.output\ndone\n\n\n\nTaxonomic k-mer-based classification of the ancient metagenomic reads can be done via KrakenUniq. However as this requires a very large database file, the results from running KrakenUniq on the 10 simulated genomes can be found in.\n#| eval: false\ncd krakenuniq/\nKrakenUniq by default delivers a proxy metric for breadth of coverage called the number of unique kmers (in the 4th column of its output table) assigned to a taxon. KrakenUniq output can be easily filtered with respect to both depth and breadth of coverage, which substantially reduces the number of false-positive hits.\n\nWe can filter the KrakenUniq output with respect to both depth (taxReads) and breadth (kmers) of coverage with the following custom Python script, which selects only species with at east 200 assigned reads and 1000 unique k-mers. After the filtering, we can see a Yersinia pestis hit in the sample 10 that possess the filtering thresholds with respect to both depth and breadth of coverage.\nRun this from within the krakenuniq/ directory.\n#| eval: false\nfor i in $(ls *.krakenuniq.output)\ndo\n../scripts/filter_krakenuniq.py $i 1000 200 ../scripts/pathogensfound.very_inclusive.tab\ndone\n\nWe can also easily produce a KrakenUniq taxonomic abundance table krakenuniq_abundance_matrix.txt using the custom R script below, which takes as argument the contents of the krakenuniq/ folder containing the KrakenUniq output files.\n#| eval: false\nRscript ../scripts/krakenuniq_abundance_matrix.R . krakenuniq_abundance_matrix/ 1000 200\nFrom the krakenuniq_abundance_matrix.txt table inside the resulting directory, it becomes clear that Yersinia pestis seems to be present in a few other samples in addition to sample 10.\n\nWhile KrakenUniq delivers information about breadth of coverage by default, you can also get this information from Kraken2.\nFor this one has to use a special flag –report-minimizer-data when running Kraken2 in order to get the breadth of coverage proxy which is called the number of distinct minimizers for the case of Kraken2. Below, we provide an example Kraken2 command line containing the distinct minimizer flag:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample only -, do not run!\n\n\n\n#| eval: false\nDBNAME=Kraken2_DB_directory\nKRAKEN_INPUT=sample.fastq.gz\nKRAKEN_OUTPUT=Kraken2_output_directory\nkraken2 --db $DBNAME --fastq-input $KRAKEN_INPUT --threads 20 \\\n--classified-out $KRAKEN_OUTPUT/classified_sequences.kraken2 \\\n--unclassified-out $KRAKEN_OUTPUT/unclassified_sequences.kraken2 \\\n--output $KRAKEN_OUTPUT/sequences.kraken2 \\\n--report $KRAKEN_OUTPUT/kraken2.output \\\n--use-names --report-minimizer-data\n\n\nThen the filtering of Kraken2 output with respect to breadth and depth of coverage can be done by analogy with filtering KrakenUniq output table. In case of de-novo assembly, the original DNA reads are typically aligned back to the assembled contigs, and the evenness / breadth of coverage can be computed from these alignments.\n\n\n12.3.3 Evenness of coverage via Samtools\nNow, after we have detected an interesting Y. pestis hit, we would like to follow it up, and compute multiple quality metrics (including proper breadth and evenness of coverage) from alignments (Bowtie2 aligner will be used in our case) of the DNA reads to the Y. pestis reference genome. Below, we download Yersinia pestis reference genome from NCBI, build its Bowtie2 index, and align trimmed reads against Yersinia pestis reference genome with Bowtie2. Do not forget to sort and index the alignments as it will be important for computing the evenness of coverage. It is also recommended to remove multi-mapping reads, i.e. the ones that have MAPQ = 0, at least for Bowtie and BWA aligners that are commonly used in ancient metagenomics. Samtools with -q flag can be used to extract reads with MAPQ &gt; = 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf guided: data preparation\n\n\n\n\n\n#| eval: false\ncd /&lt;path/&lt;to&gt;/authentication/bowtie2\n\n## Download reference genome\nNCBI=https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov; ID=GCF_000222975.1_ASM22297v1\nwget $NCBI/genomes/all/GCF/000/222/975/${ID}/${ID}_genomic.fna.gz\n\n\n\n#| eval: false\ncd /&lt;path/&lt;to&gt;/authentication/bowtie2\n\n## Prepare reference genome and build Bowtie2 index\ngunzip GCF_000222975.1_ASM22297v1_genomic.fna.gz; echo NC_017168.1 &gt; region.bed\nseqtk subseq GCF_000222975.1_ASM22297v1_genomic.fna region.bed &gt; NC_017168.1.fasta\nbowtie2-build --large-index NC_017168.1.fasta NC_017168.1.fasta --threads 10\n\n## Run alignment of raw reads against FASTQ\nbowtie2 --large-index -x NC_017168.1.fasta --end-to-end --threads 10 \\\n--very-sensitive -U ../rawdata/sample10.trimmed.fastq.gz | samtools view -bS -h -q 1 \\\n-@ 20 - &gt; Y.pestis_sample10.bam\n\n## Sort and index BAM files for rapid access in downstream commands\nsamtools sort Y.pestis_sample10.bam -@ 10 &gt; Y.pestis_sample10.sorted.bam\nsamtools index Y.pestis_sample10.sorted.bam\nNext, the breadth / evenness of coverage can be computed from the BAM-alignments via samtools depth as follows:\n#| eval: false\nsamtools depth -a Y.pestis_sample10.sorted.bam &gt; Y.pestis_sample10.sorted.boc\nand visualized using for example the following R code snippet (alternatively aDNA-BAMPlotter can be used).\nLoad R by running R in your terminal\n#| eval: false\nR\nNote the following may take a minute or so to run.\n# Read output of samtools depth commans\ndf &lt;- read.delim(\"Y.pestis_sample10.sorted.boc\", header = FALSE, sep = \"\\t\")\nnames(df) &lt;- c(\"Ref\", \"Pos\", \"N_reads\")\n\n# Split reference genome in tiles, compute breadth of coverage for each tile\nN_tiles &lt;- 500\nstep &lt;- (max(df$Pos) - min(df$Pos)) / N_tiles\ntiles &lt;- c(0:N_tiles) * step; boc &lt;- vector()\nfor(i in 1:length(tiles))\n{\n  df_loc &lt;- df[df$Pos &gt;= tiles[i] & df$Pos &lt; tiles[i+1], ]\n  boc &lt;- append(boc, rep(sum(df_loc$N_reads &gt; 0) / length(df_loc$N_reads),\n  dim(df_loc)[1]))\n}\n\nboc[is.na(boc)]&lt;-0; df$boc &lt;- boc\nplot(df$boc ~ df$Pos, type = \"s\", xlab = \"Genome position\", ylab = \"Coverage\")\nabline(h = 0, col = \"red\", lty = 2)\nmtext(paste0(round((sum(df$N_reads &gt; 0) / length(df$N_reads)) * 100, 2), \n\"% of genome covered\"), cex = 0.8)\nOnce finished examining the plot you can quit R\n#| eval: false\n## Press 'n' when asked if you want to save your workspace image.\nquit()\n\nIn the R script above, we simply split the reference genome into N_tiles tiles and compute the breadth of coverage (number of reference nucleotides covered by at least one read normalized by the total length) locally in each tile. By visualizing how the local breadth of coverage changes from tile to tile, we can monitor the distribution of the reads across the reference genome. In the evenness of coverage figure above, the reads seem to cover all parts of the reference genome uniformly, which is a good evidence of true-positive detection, even though the total mean breadth of coverage is low due to the low total number of reads.\n\n\n12.3.4 Alignment quality\nIn addition to evenness and breadth of coverage, it is very informative to monitor how well the metagenomic reads map to a reference genome. Here one can control for mapping quality (MAPQ field in the BAM-alignments) and the number of mismatches for each read, i.e. edit distance.\nMapping quality (MAPQ) can be extracted from the 5th column of BAM-alignments using Samtools and cut command in bash.\n#| eval: false\nsamtools view Y.pestis_sample10.sorted.bam | cut -f5 &gt; mapq.txt\nThen the 5th column of the filtered BAM-alignment can be visualized via a simple histogram in R as below for two random metagenomic samples.\nLoad R\n#| eval: false\nR\nAnd generate the histogram with.\nhist(as.numeric(readLines(\"mapq.txt\")), col = \"darkred\", breaks = 100)\n\nNote that MAPQ scores are computed slightly differently for Bowtie and BWA, so they are not directly comparable, however, for both MAPQ ~ 10-30, as in the histograms below, indicates good affinity of the DNA reads to the reference genome. here we provide some examples of how typical MAPQ histograms for Bowtie2 and BWA alignments can look like:\n\nEdit distance can be extracted by gathering information in the NM-tag inside BAM-alignments, which reports the number of mismatches for each aligned read. This can be done either in bash / awk, or using handy functions from Rsamtools R package:\nlibrary(\"Rsamtools\")\nparam &lt;- ScanBamParam(tag = \"NM\")\nbam &lt;- scanBam(\"Y.pestis_sample10.sorted.bam\", param = param)\nbarplot(table(bam[[1]]$tag$NM), ylab=\"Number of reads\", xlab=\"Number of mismatches\")\nOnce finished examining the plot you can quit R.\n#| eval: false\n## Press 'n' when asked if you want to save your workspace image.\nquit()\n\nIn the barplot above we can see that the majority of reads align either without or with very few mismatches, which is an evidence of high affinity of the aligned reads with respect to the reference genome. For a true-positive finding, the edit distance barplot typically has a decreasing profile. However, for a very degraded DNA, it can have a mode around 1 or 2, which can also be reasonable. A false-positive hit would have a mode of the edit distance barplot shifted toward higher numbers of mismatches.\n\n\n12.3.5 Affinity to reference\nVery related to edit distance is another alignment validation metric which is called percent identity. It represents a barplot demonstrating the numbers of reads that are 100% identical to the reference genome (i.e. map without a single mismatch), 99% identical, 98% identical etc. Misaligned reads originating from another related organism have typically most reads with percent identity of 93-96%. In the figure below, the panels (c–e) demonstrate different percent identity distributions. In panel c, most reads show a high similarity to the reference, which indicates a correct assignment of the reads to the reference. In panel d, most reads are highly dissimilar to the reference, which suggests that they originate from different related species. In some cases, as in panel e, a mixture of correctly assigned and misassigned reads can be observed.\n\nAnother important way to detect reads that cross-map between related species is haploidy or checking the amount of multi-allelic SNPs. Because bacteria are haploid organisms, only one allele is expected for each genomic position. Only a small number of multi-allelic sites are expected, which can result from a few mis-assigned or incorrectly aligned reads. In the figure above, panels (f–i) demonstrate histograms of SNP allele frequency distributions. Panel f demonstrates the situation when we have only a few multi-allelic sites originating from a misaligned reads. This is a preferable case scenario corresponding to correct assignment of the reads to the reference. Please also check the corresponding “Good alignments” IGV visualization to the right in the figure above.\nIn contrast, a large number of multi-allelic sites indicates that the assigned reads originate from more than one species or strain, which can result in symmetric allele frequency distributions (e.g., if two species or strains are present in equal abundance) (panel g) or asymmetric distributions (e.g., if two species or strains are present in unequal abundance) (panel h). A large number of mis-assigned reads from closely related species can result in a large number of multi-allelic sites with low frequencies of the derived allele (panel i). The situations (g-i) correspond to incorrect assignment of the reads to the reference. Please also check the corresponding “Bad alignments” IGV visualization to the right in the figure above.",

    "text": "12.4 Ancient-specific genomic hit validation criteria\nIn contrast to modern genomic hit validation criteria, the ancient-specific validation methods concentrate on DNA degradation and damage pattern as ultimate signs of ancient DNA. Below, we will discuss deamination profile, read length distribution and post mortem damage (PMD) scores metrics that provide good confirmation of ancient origin of the detected organism.\n\n12.4.1 Degradation patterns\nChecking evenness of coverage and alignment quality can help us to make sure that the organism we are thinking about is really present in the metagenomic sample. However, we still need to address the question “How ancinet?”. For this purpose we need to compute deamination profile and read length distribution of the aligned reads in order to prove that they demonstrate damage pattern and are sufficiently fragmented, which would be a good evidence of ancient origin of the detected organisms.\nDeamination profile of a damaged DNA demonstrate an enrichment of C / T polymorphisms at the ends of the reads compared to all other single nucleotide substitutions. There are several tools for computing deamination profile, but perhaps the most popular is mapDamage. The tool can be run using the following command line, still in the authentication/bowtie2/ directory:\n#| eval: false\nmapDamage -i Y.pestis_sample10.sorted.bam -r NC_017168.1.fasta -d mapDamage_results/ --merge-reference-sequences --no-stats\n\nmaDamage delivers a bunch of useful statistics, among other read length distribution can be checked. A typical mode of DNA reads should be within a range 30-70 base-pairs in order to be a good evidence of DNA fragmentation. Reads longer tha 100 base-pairs are more likely to originate from modern contamination.\n\nAnother useful tool that can be applied to assess how DNA is damaged is PMDtools which is a maximum-likelihood probabilistic model that calculates an ancient score, PMD score, for each read. The ability of PMDtools to infer ancient status with a single read resolution is quite unique and different from mapDamage that can only assess deamination based on a number of reads. PMD scores can be computed using the following command line, please note that Python2 is needed for this purpose.\n#| eval: false\nsamtools view -h Y.pestis_sample10.bam | pmdtools --printDS &gt; PMDscores.txt\nThe distribution of PMD scores can be visualized via a histogram in R as follows.\nLoad R.\nR\nThen generate the histogram.\npmd_scores &lt;- read.delim(\"PMDscores.txt\", header = FALSE, sep = \"\\t\")\nhist(pmd_scores$V4, breaks = 1000, xlab = \"PMDscores\")\nOnce finished examining the plot you can quit R\n#| eval: false\n## Press 'n' when asked if you want to save your workspace image.\nquit()\n\nTypically, reads with PMD scores greater than 3 are considered to be reliably ancient, i.e. damaged, and can be extracted for taking a closer look. Therefore PMDtools is great for separating ancient reads from modern contaminant reads.\nAs mapDamage, PMDtools can also compute deamination profile. However, the advantage of PMDtools that it can compute deamination profile for UDG / USER treated samples (with the flag –CpG). For this purpose, PMDtools uses only CpG sites which escape the treatment, so deamination is not gone completely and there is a chance to authenticate treated samples. Computing deamination pattern with PMDtools can be achieved with the following command line (please note that the scripts pmdtools.0.60.py and plotPMD.v2.R can be downloaded from the github repository here https://github.com/pontussk/PMDtools):\n#| eval: false\nsamtools view Y.pestis_sample10.bam | pmdtools --platypus &gt; PMDtemp.txt\nWe can then run simple R commands directly from the terminal (without loading R itself with) the following.\n#| eval: false\nR CMD BATCH plotPMD\n\nWhen performing ancient status analysis on de-novo assembled contigs, it can be computationally challenging and time consuming to run mapDamage or PMDtools on all of them as there can be hundreds of thousands contigs. In addition, the outputs from mapDamage and PMDtools lacking a clear numeric quantity or a statistical test that could provide an “ancient vs. non-ancient” decision for each de-novo assembled contig. To address these limitations, pyDamage tool was recently developed. PyDamage evaluates the amount of aDNA damage and tests the hypothesis whether a model assuming presence of aDNA damage better explains the data than a null model.\n\npyDamage can be run on a sorted BAM-alignments of the microbial reads to the de-novo assembled contigs using the following command line:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample command - do not run!\n\n\n\n#| eval: false\npydamage analyze -w 30 -p 14 filtered.sorted.bam",

    "text": "13.1 Decontamination\nModern contamination is one of the major problems in ancient metagenomics analysis. Large fractions of modern bacterial, animal or human DNA in metagenomic samples can lead to false biological and historical conclusions. A lot of scientific literature is dedicated to this topic, and comprehensive tables and sources of potential contamination (e.g. animal and bacterial DNA present in PCR reagents) are available.\nA good practice to discriminate between endogenous and contaminant organisms is to sequence negative controls, so-called blanks. Organisms detected on blanks, like the microbial genera reported in the table below, can substantially facilitate making more informed decision about true metagenomic profile of a sample. Nevertheless, the table below may seem rather conservative since in addition to well-known environmental contaminants as Burkholderia and Pseudomonas it includes also human oral genera as Streptococcus, which are probably less likely to be of environmental origin.\nIt is typically assumed that an organism found on a blank has a lower confidence to be endogenous to the studied metagenomic sample, and sometimes it is even excluded from the downstream analysis as an unreliable hit. Despite there are attempts to automate filtering out modern contaminants (we will discuss them below), decontamination process still remains to be a tedious manual work where each candidate should be carefully investigated from different contexts in order to prove its ancient and endogenous origin.\nIf negative control samples (blanks) are available, contaminating organisms can be detected by comparing their abundances in the negative controls with true samples. In this case, contaminant organisms stand out by their high prevalence in both types of samples if one simply plots mean across samples abundance of each detected organism in true samples and negative controls against each other as in the figure below.\nFirst move back into the KrakenUniq folder and load R.\nThen in here we can compare between true samples and negative controls\nOnce finished examining the plot you can quit R\nIn the figure above, one point indicates an organism detected in a group of metagenomic samples. The points highlighted by red have high abundance in negative control samples, and therefore they are likely contamiannts.\nIn addition to PCR reagents and lab contaminants, reference databses can also be contaminanted by various, often microbial, organisms. A typical example that when screening environmental or sedimentary ancient DNA samples, a fish Cyprinos carpio can pop up if adapter trimming procedure was not successful for some reason.\nIt was noticed that the Cyprinos carpio reference genome available at NCBI contains large fraction of Illumina sequncing adapters. Therefore, appearence of this organism in your analysis may falsely lead your conclusion toward potential lake or river present in the excavation site.",

One of them is decontam R package that offers a simple statistical test for whether a detected organism is likely contaminant. This approach is useful when DNA quantitation data recording the concentration of DNA in each sample (e.g. PicoGreen fluorescent intensity measures) is available. The idea of the decontam is that contaminant DNA is expected to be present in approximately equal and low concentrations across samples, while sample DNA concentrations can vary widely. As a result, the expected frequency of contaminant DNA varies inversely with total sample DNA concentration (red line in the figure below), while the expected frequency of non-contaminant DNA does not (blue line).\n\n\n\n13.1.2 recentrifuge\nAnother popular tool for detecting contaminating microorganisms is Recentrifuge. It works as a classifier that is trained to recognize contaminant microbial organisms. In case of Recentrifuge, one has to use blanks or other negative controls and provide microbial names and abundances on the blanks in order to train Recentrifuge to recognize endogenous vs. contaminant sources.\n\n\n13.1.3 cuperdec\nIf one wants to assess the degree of contamination for each sample, there is a handy tool cuperdec, which is an R package that allows a quick comparison of microbial profiles in a query metagenomic sample against a database. The idea of cuperdec is to rank organisms in each sample by their abundance and then using an “expanding window” approach to compute their enrichment in a reference database that contains a comprehensive list of microbial organisms which are specific to a tissue / environment in question. The tool produces so-called Cumulative Percent Decay curves that aim to represent the level of endogenous content of microbiome samples, such as ancient dental calculus, to help to identify samples with low levels of preservation that should be discarded for downstream analysis.\nFirst change into the cuperdec directory, and load R\n#| eval: false\ncd /&lt;path&gt;/&lt;to&gt;/contamination/cuperdec\nThen we can load the files, generate the decay curves, set a preservation threshold cut-off, and plot the result.\nLoad R as usual.\n#| eval: false\nR\nThen load the libraries and run the typical cuperdec workflow.\nlibrary(\"cuperdec\"); library(\"magrittr\"); library(\"dplyr\")\n\n# Load database (in this case an internal 'test' oral database from the package)\ndata(cuperdec_database_ex)\ndatabase &lt;- load_database(cuperdec_database_ex, target = \"oral\") %&gt;% print()\n\n# Load abundance matrix and metadata\nraw_table &lt;- read.delim(\"../krakenuniq/krakenuniq_abundance_matrix/krakenuniq_abundance_matrix.txt\", row.names=1) %&gt;% as_tibble(rownames='Taxon')\ntaxatable &lt;- load_taxa_table(raw_table)  %&gt;% print()\nmetadata &lt;- as_tibble(data.frame(Sample = unique(taxatable$Sample),\nSample_Source = \"Oral\"))\n\n# Compute cumulative percent decay curves, filter and plot results\ncurves &lt;- calculate_curve(taxatable, database = database) %&gt;% print()\nfilter_result &lt;- simple_filter(curves, percent_threshold = 50) %&gt;% print()\nplot_cuperdec(curves, metadata = metadata, filter_result)\nOnce finished examining the plot you can quit R\n#| eval: false\n## Press 'n' when asked if you want to save your workspace image.\nquit()\n\nIn the figure above, one curve represents one sample, and the red curves have a very high amount of contamination and very low amount of endogenous DNA.

SourceTracker is a Bayesian version of the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering algorithm that is trained on a user-supplied reference data called Sources, i.e. different classes such as Soil or Human Oral or Human Gut microbial communities etc., and then it can estimate proportion / contribution of each of these sources the users actual samples called Sinks.\n\nOriginally, SourceTracker was developed for 16S data, i.e. using only 16S ribosomal RNA genes, but it can be easily trained using also shotgun metagenomics data, which was demonstrated in its metagenomic extension called mSourceTracker and its faster and more scalable version FEAST. The input data for SourceTracker are metadata, i.e. each sample has to have “source” or “sink” annotation as well as environmental label (e.g. Oral, Gut, Soil etc.), and microbial abundances (OTU abundances) quantified in some way, for example through QIIME pipeline, MetaPhlan or Kraken. The SourceTracker R script can be downloaded from https://github.com/danknights/sourcetracker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf guided: data preparation\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the input files (already prepared for you), you will also need to clone the Sourcetracker 1 R code repository (unfortunately it’s not available as a package)\n\n#| eval: false\ncd /&lt;path&gt;/&lt;to&gt;/contamination/sourcetracker/\ngit clone https://github.com/danknights/sourcetracker.git\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatching sourcetracker for newer R versions\n\n\n\nUnfortunately Sourcetracker’s original R code was done a very long time ago, and has resulted in some incompatiblities with more recent versions of R.\nIf using a more recent version of R (such as in this chapter’s conda environment), you will need to perform the following ‘patching’ of the code, to prevent an error.\nRun the following command to comment out the offending lines (538, 539), where R’s behaviour in later versions of a fundamental validation function has changed.\n\n#| eval: false\nsed -i '538,539s/^/#/' sourcetracker/src/SourceTracker.r\n\n\n\n\n\nSourcetracker expects two input data frames: metadata with at least sample name, environment and source / sink labels, and abundance matrix. Note that source and sink metadata and abundances have to be merged together prior to using SourceTracker. Here we are going to use data from the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) as sources, and we are going to merge the HMP data with the sink samples into single OTU table and meta-data table.\n#| eval: false\ncd /&lt;path&gt;/&lt;to&gt;/contamination/sourcetracker/\n\n## Load R\nR\nThen in R we can load the HMP source files, and our ‘sink samples’ from the KrakenUniq matrix we made earlier, and clean them up to make them compatible for Sourcetracker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe’ve included the Sourcetracker R script in the repository for you, as it’s not available on conda.\n\n\n## Load files\notus_hmp &lt;- read.delim(\"otus_hmp.txt\", header = TRUE, row.names = 1, sep = \"\\t\")\nmeta_hmp &lt;- read.delim(\"meta_hmp.txt\", header = TRUE, row.names = 1, sep = \"\\t\")\notus_sink&lt;-read.delim(\"../krakenuniq/krakenuniq_abundance_matrix/krakenuniq_abundance_matrix.txt\",header=T,row.names=1,sep=\"\\t\")\n\n## Join source and sink tables into one\notus &lt;- merge(otus_hmp, otus_sink, all = TRUE, by = \"row.names\")\n\n## Put OTU IDs as row names and replace NAs with 0\nrownames(otus) &lt;- otus$Row.names; otus$Row.names &lt;- NULL; otus[is.na(otus)] &lt;- 0\n\n## Set column and row names for meta\nmeta_sink &lt;- data.frame(ID = colnames(otus_sink), Env = \"Unknown\", SourceSink = \"sink\")\nrownames(meta_sink) &lt;- meta_sink$ID; meta_sink$ID&lt;-NULL\nmetadata &lt;- rbind(meta_hmp, meta_sink)\n\n## Further value cleanups and sample filtering to remove not useful HMP samples\notus &lt;- as.data.frame(t(as.matrix(otus)))\notus[otus &gt; 0] &lt;- 1; otus &lt;- otus[rowSums(otus)!=0,]\nmetadata&lt;-metadata[as.character(metadata$Env)!=\"Vaginal\",]; envs &lt;- metadata$Env\ncommon.sample.ids &lt;- intersect(rownames(metadata), rownames(otus))\notus &lt;- otus[common.sample.ids,]; metadata &lt;- metadata[common.sample.ids,]\nNext, training SourceTracker on source samples and running predictions on sink samples can be done using following commands:\n# Train SourceTracker on sources (HMP) and run predictions on sinks\nsource('sourcetracker/src/SourceTracker.r')\ntrain.ix &lt;- which(metadata$SourceSink=='source')\ntest.ix &lt;- which(metadata$SourceSink=='sink')\nst &lt;- sourcetracker(otus[train.ix,], envs[train.ix])\nresults &lt;- predict(st, otus[test.ix,], alpha1 = 0.001, alpha2 = 0.001)\nFinally, we can plot SourceTracker environment inference in the form of barcharts as follows:\n# Sort SourceTracker proportions for plotting\nprops &lt;- results$proportions\nprops &lt;- props[order(-props[,\"Oral\"]),]\nresults$proportions &lt;- props\n\n# Prepare SourceTracker output for plotting\nname &lt;- rep(rownames(results$proportions), each = 4)\nvalue &lt;- as.numeric(t(results$proportions))\nlabels &lt;- c(\"Gut\",\"Oral\",\"Skin\",\"Unknown\"); condition&lt;-rep(labels, length(test.ix))\ndata &lt;- data.frame(name, condition, value)\n\n# Plot SourceTracker inference as a barplot\nlibrary(\"ggplot2\")\nggplot(data, aes(fill=condition, y=value, x = reorder(name, seq(1:length(name))))) +\ngeom_bar(position = \"fill\", stat = \"identity\") +\ntheme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, size=5, hjust=1, vjust=0.5)) +\nxlab(\"Sample\") + ylab(\"Fraction\")\nOnce finished examining the plot you can quit R\n#| eval: false\n## Press 'n' when asked if you want to save your workspace image.\nquit()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.1: Stacked barchart of each sample (sinks) with the estimated fraction of each source ‘sample group’ that each sink is made up of. Note that the X-axis sorting of samples may change between each person, thus your plot may not match exactly the same as the one here.\n\n\n\nIn the figure above (Figure 13.1) the SourceTracker was trained on Human Microbiome Project (HMP) data, and was capable of predicting the fractions of oral, gut, skin or other microbial composition on the query sink samples. In a similar way, environmental soil or marine microbes can be used as Sources. In this way, environmental percentage of contamination can be detected per sample.\nA drawback of SourceTracker, mSourceTracker and FEAST is that they require a microbial abundance table after a taxonomic classification with e.g. QIIME or Kraken has been performed. Such taxonomic classification can be biased since it is computed against a reference database with known taxonomic annotation. In contrast, a novel microbial source tracking tool decOM aims at moving away from database-dependent methods and using unsupervised approaches exploiting read-level sequence composition.\n\n\n\n13.2.2 deCOM\ndecOM uses kmtricks to compute a matrix of k-mer counts on raw reads (FASTQ files) from source samples, and then uses the source k-mer abundance matrix for looking up k-mer composition of sink samples. This allows decOM to calculate microbial contributions / fractions from the sources. For example, for estimating contributions from ancient Oral (aOral), modern Oral (mOral), Skin and Sediment / Soil environments one can use an already computed source matrix from here https://github.com/CamilaDuitama/decOM/ and provide it as a -p_sources parameter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf guided: data preparation\n\n\n\n\n\nIf doing a self-guided tutorial, you will need to download a rather large pre-built database.\n#| eval: false\n## In the directory\n## Note that decOM does not like dots in names so make symlinks\nfor i in ../rawdata/*trimmed.fastq.gz; do\n  ln -s \"$i\" \"${i/.trimmed/_trimmed}\"\ndone\n\n# Prepare input fof-files that have a key - value format\nfor i in {1..10}; do\n  echo \"sample${i}_trimmed : sample${i}_trimmed.fastq.gz\" &gt; sample${i}_trimmed.fof\n  echo sample${i}_trimmed &gt;&gt; FASTQ_NAMES_LIST.txt;\ndone\n\n# Download pre-built kmer-matrix of sources (aOral, mOral, Sediment/Soil, Skin)\nwget https://zenodo.org/record/6513520/files/decOM_sources.tar.gz\ntar -xf decOM_sources.tar.gz\n\n\n\nThe following example command is how you would execute deCOM. However as this requires a very large database file and thus large memory requirements, therefore we have already made available for you the output files from this step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample command - do not run!\n\n\n\n#| eval: false\n# DO NOT RUN!: Run decOM predictions\ndecOM -p_sources decOM_sources/ -p_sinks FASTQ_NAMES_LIST.txt -p_keys decOM/FASTQ -mem 900GB -t 15\n\n\nYou can find the relevant output files for the rest of this chapter in the following directory already prepared for you i.e.the output of deCOM with our simulated data from the command above.\n#| eval: false\ncd /&lt;path&gt;/&lt;to&gt;/contamination/decom\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe entire output from running deCOM on the simulated data was 29GB!\n\n\nIn the example command line used to generate, the -p_sinks parameter provides a list of sink samples, for example SRR13355807.\nThe sink fastq-files are placed together with keys fof-files containing the mapping between fastq file names and locations of the fastq-files, for example SRR13355807 : SRR13355807.fastq.gz. The contributions from the sources to the sink samples, which are recorded in the decOM_output.csv output file (which is in the contamination/decom directory already for you), can then be processed and plotted as follows:\nLoad R\n#| eval: false\nR\nThen we can make a plot\ndf&lt;-read.csv(\"decOM_output.csv\", check.names=FALSE)\n\nresult &lt;- subset(df, select = c(\"Sink\", \"Sediment/Soil\", \"Skin\", \"aOral\",\n\"mOral\", \"Unknown\"))\nrownames(result) &lt;- result$Sink; result$Sink &lt;- NULL\nresult &lt;- result / rowSums(result)\nresult&lt;-result[order(-result$aOral),]\n\nname &lt;- rep(rownames(result), each = 5); value &lt;- as.numeric(t(result))\ncondition &lt;- rep(c(\"Sediment/Soil\",\"Skin\",\"aOral\",\"mOral\",\"Unknown\"),\ndim(result)[1])\ndata &lt;- data.frame(name, condition, value)\n\nlibrary(\"ggplot2\"); library(\"viridis\")\nggplot(data, aes(fill=condition, y=value, x=reorder(name,seq(1:length(name))))) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\", stat = \"identity\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90, size = 5, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5)) +\n  xlab(\"Sample\") + ylab(\"Fraction\")\nOnce finished examining the plot you can quit R\n#| eval: false\n## Press 'n' when asked if you want to save your workspace image.\nquit()\n\ndecOM has certain advantages compared to SourceTracker as its is a taxonomic classification / database free approach. However, it also appears to be very sensitive to the particular training / source data set. In the example above it can be seen that the microbial source tracking of sink samples is very much dominated by the Oral community, which was the training / source data set.",

    "text": "Genome Mapping\nAn important step in the reconstruction of full genomic sequences is mapping. Even relatively short genomes usually cannot be sequenced as a single consecutive piece. Instead, millions of short sequence reads are generated from genomic fragments. These reads can be several hundred nucleotides in length but are considerably shorter for ancient DNA (aDNA).\nFor many applications involving comparative genomics these ‘reads’ have to be aligned to one or multiple already-reconstructed reference genomes in order to identify differences between the sequenced genome and any given contextual dataset. Aligning millions of short reads to much longer genome sequences in a time-efficient and accurate manner is a bioinformatics challenge for which numerous algorithms and tools have been developed. Each of these programs comes with a variety of parameters that can significantly alter the results and default settings are often not optimal when working with aDNA. Furthermore, read mapping procedures are often part of complex computational genomics pipelines and are therefore not directly applied by many users.\nIn this chapter we will take a look at specific challenges during read mapping when dealing with aDNA. We will get an overview of common input and output formats and manually apply a read mapper to aDNA data studying the direct effects of variation in mapping parameters. We will conclude the session with an outlook on genotyping, which is an important follow-up analysis step, that in turn is very relevant for down-stream analyses such as phylogenetics.",

For a detailed explanation of the read alignment problem and an overview of concepts for solving it, please see https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-genom-090413-025358.\nIn this session we will map two samples to the Yersinia pestis (plague) genome using different parameter sets. We will do this “manually” in the sense that we will use all necessary commands one by one in the terminal. These commands usually run in the background when you apply DNA sequencing data processing pipelines.\nWe will be using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (Li et al. 2009 – http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net). There are different algorithms implemented for different types of data (e.g. different read lengths). Here, we use BWA backtrack (bwa aln), which is suitable for Illumina sequences up to 100bp.

Ideally we use a genome from the same species that our data relates to or, if not available, a closely related species. The selection of the correct reference genome is highly relevant.

Reference genomes can be retrieved from comprehensive databases such as NCBI.\nIn your directory, you can find 2 samples and your reference.

    "text": "14.3 Mapping Parameters\nWe will be using bwa aln, but we need to specify parameters. For now we will concentrate on the “seed length” and the “maximum edit distance”. We will use the default setting for all other parameters during this session. The choice of the right parameters depend on many factors such as the type of data and the specific use case. One aspect is the mapping sensitivity, i.e. how different a read can be from the chosen reference and still be mapped. In this context we generally differentiate between strict and lenient mapping parameters.\nAs many other mapping algorithms bwa uses a so-called “seed-and-extend” approach. I.e. it initially maps the first N nucleotides of each read to the genome with relatively few mismatches and thereby determines candidate positions for the more time-intensive full alignment.\nA short seed length will generate more such candidate positions and therefore mapping will take longer, but it will also be more sensitive, i.e. there can be more differences between the read and the genome. Long seeds are less sensitive but the mapping procedure is faster.\nIn this session we will use the following two parameter sets:\nLenient\nAllow for more mismatches → -n 0.01\nShort seed length → -l 16\nStrict\nAllow for less mismatches → -n 0.1\nLong seed length → -l 32\nWe will be working with pre-processed files (sample1.fastq.gz, sample2.fastq.gz), i.e. any quality filtering and removal of sequencing adapters is already done.\nWe will map each file once with lenient and once with strict parameters.

    "text": "14.9 Examples\nPlease find here a few examples for exploration. To get a better visualization we only loaded sample2_lenient (top track) and sample2_strict (bottom track):\n\nYou can see all aligned reads in the current genomic region as stacks of grey arrows. In the middle of the image you see brown dashes in all of the reads. This is a SNP. You also see sporadically green or red dashes in some reads but not all of them at a given position. These sporadic differences are DNA damage such as we typically find it for ancient DNA.\nFor jumping to a specific coordinate you need to enter it into the coordinate field at the top:\n\nE.g. if you enter 12326942 after the colon in the coordinate field and hit enter, you will jump to the same position as in the screenshot above.\nLet’s have a look at some positions.\nFor example position 36472:\n\nIn the middle of the image you see a SNP (T) that was called with strict parameters (bottom) but not with lenient parameters (top). But why would it not be called in the top track? It is not called because there are three reads that cover the same position, but do not contain the T. We can see that these reads have other difference to the reference at other positions. That’s why they are not mapped with strict parameters. It is quite likely that they originate from a different species. This example demonstrates that sensitive mapping parameters might actually lead to a loss of certain SNP calls.\nDoes this mean that stricter parameters will always give us a clean mapping? Let’s have a look at position 219200:\n\nYou might need to zoom out a bit using the slider in the upper right corner.\nSo, what is going on here? We see a lot of variation in most of the reads. This is reduced a bit with strict mapping parameters (bottom track) but the effect is still quite pronounced. Here, we see a region that seems to be conserved in other species as well, so we have a lot of mapping from other organisms. We can’t compensate that with stricter mapping parameters and we would have to apply some filtering on genotype level to remove this variation from our genotyping. Removing false positive SNP calls is important as it would interfere with downstream analyses such as phylogenomics.\nSuch regions can be fairly large. For example, see this 20 kb region around position 224750:",

    "text": "15.2 Visualize the sequence alignment\nIn this practical session, we will be working with an alignment produced as you learned in the practical Genome mapping.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is in the data?\n\n\n\n\nthe alignment is a SNP alignment (it contains only the variable genomic positions, not the full genomes)\nit contains 33 Yersinia pestis sequences and 1 Yersinia pseudotuberculosis sequence which can be used as an outgroup\nin this practical, we will investigate the phylogenetic position of four prehistorical Y. pestis strains that we have recently discovered: KZL002, GZL002, CHC004 and VLI092\n\n\n\nWe start by exploring the alignment in MEGA. Open the MEGA desktop application by typing mega & in the terminal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAdding “&” at the end of a command line allows to run a program in the background while letting the terminal accessible. This particularly useful when starting a graphical interface from the terminal.\n\n\nThen, load the alignment by clicking on File -&gt; Open A File/Session -&gt; Select the snpAlignment_session5.fasta (in the working directory of the session).\n\nIt will you ask what you want to do with the alignment. In MEGA you can also produce an alignment, however, since our sequences are already aligned we will press on Analyze.\nThen we will select Nucleotide Sequences since we are working with a DNA alignment. Note that MEGA can also work with Protein Sequences as well as Pairwise Distance Matrix (which we will cover shortly). In the same window, we will change the character for Missing Data to N and click in OK.\n\nA window would open up asking if our alignment contains protein encoding sequences, and we will select No.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you had protein encoding sequences, you would have selected Yes. This will allow you to treat different positions with different evolutionary modes depending on their codon position. One can do this to take in account that the third codon position can change to different nucleotides without resulting in a different amino acid, while position one and two of the codon are more restricted.\n\n\nTo explore the alignment, you will then click on the box with TA\n\nYou will see an alignment containing sequences from the bacterial pathogen Yersinia pestis. Within the alignment, we have four sequences of interest (KZL002, GZL002, CHC004 and VLI092) that date between 5000-2000 years Before Present (BP), and we want to know how they relate to the rest of the Yersinia pestis genomes in the alignment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nHow many sequences are we analysing?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are analysing 34 sequences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nWhat are the Ns in the sequences?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThey represent positions where we have missing data.

    "text": "15.3 Distance-based phylogeny: Neighbour Joining\nThe Neighbour Joining (NJ) method is an agglomerative algorithm which can be used to derive a phylogenetic tree from a pairwise distance matrix. In essence, this method will be grouping taxa that have the shortest distance together first, and will be doing this iteratively until all the taxa/sequences included in your alignment have been placed in a tree.\nHere are the details of the calculations for a small NJ tree example with 6 taxa:\n\nLuckily, you won’t have to do this by hand since MEGA allows you to build a NJ tree. For that go back to MEGA and click on the Phylogeny symbol (toolbar of the main menu window) and then select Construct Neighbour Joining Tree. Type “Yes” when you are asked if you want to use the currently active date. In the window that pop up, you will then chance the Model/Method to p-distance. Then press OK and a window with the calculated phylogenetic tree will pop up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np-distances?\n\n\n\nA NJ tree can be built from any type of distances. This includes:\n\np-distances (also called raw distances): these are simply the proportion of differences between sequences\ncorrected distances: these are based on an underlying substitution model (JC69, K80, GTR…) and account for multiple substitutions at the same sites (which would result in only one visible difference)\np-distances and corrected distances should be similar when the number of substitutions is low compared to the genome length\n\nnote: a “substitution” is a type of mutation in which a nucleotide is replaced by another.\n\n\nSince the tree is not easily visualised in MEGA, we will export it in newick format (a standard text format for trees) and explore our tree in FigTree. This tool has a better interface for visually manipulating trees and allows us to interact with the phylogenetic tree.\nTo do that you will click on File, then Export current tree (Newick) and click on Branch Lengths to include those in the newick annotation. When you press OK, a new window with the tree in newick format will pop up and you will then press File -&gt; Save and saved it as NJ_tree.nwk. You can then close the text editor and tree explorer windows (no need to save the session).\n\nAs said above, we will explore own NJ tree in FigTree. Open the software by typing figtree & in the terminal (if you use the same terminal window as the one in which you ran mega, you might have to press enter first). Then, open the NJ tree by clicking on File -&gt; Open and selecting the file with the NJ tree NJ_tree.nwk\n\nNote that even though a root is displayed by default in FigTree, NJ trees are actually unrooted. We know that Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (labelled here as Y. pseudotuberculosis) is an outgroup to Yersinia pestis. You can reroot the tree by selecting Y.pseudotuberculosis and pressing Reroot.\n\nNow we have a rooted tree.\n::: {.callout-tip title=“Question” appearance=“simple”}\nHow much time did the NJ-tree calculation take?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n~1 second\n\n\n\nHow many leaves/tips has our tree?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n34, i.e. the number of sequences in our SNP alignment.\n\n\n\nWhere are our taxa of interest?

    "text": "15.5 Maximum likelihood estimation and bootstrapping\nOne way we can make inferences from a probabilistic model is by finding the combination of parameters which maximises the likelihood. These parameter values are called maximum likelihood (ML) estimates. We are usually not able to compute the likelihood value for all possible combinations of parameters and have to rely on heuristic algorithms to find the maximum likelihood estimates.\n\nThe Maximum likelihood estimates are point estimates, i.e. single parameter values (for example, a tree), which does not allow to measure the associated uncertainty. A classic method to measure the uncertainty in ML trees is bootstrapping, which consists in repeatedly “disturbing” the alignment by masking sites randomly and estimating a tree from each of these bootstrap alignments.\n\nFor each clade in the ML tree, a bootstrap support value is computed which corresponds to the proportion of bootstrap trees containing the clade. This gives an indication of how robustly the clade is supported by the data (i.e. whether it holds even after disturbing the dataset). Bootstrapping can be used to measure the topology uncertainty of trees estimated with any inference method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBootstrapping can be used to measure uncertainty with any type of inference method, including distance methods\n\n\nLet’s make our own ML tree!\nHere is a command to estimate an ML phylogenetic tree together with bootstraps using RAxML (you may find the list of parameters in the RAxML manual):\n#| eval: false\nraxmlHPC-PTHREADS -m GTRGAMMA -T 3 -f a -x 12345 -p 12345 -N autoMRE -s snpAlignment_session5.fasta -n full_dataset.tre\nHere is the meaning of the chosen parameters:\n\nOnce the analysis has been completed, you can open the tree using Figtree (RAxML_bipartitions.full_dataset.tre file, change “label” to “bootstrap support” at the prompt).\n\nThe tree estimated using this model is a substitution tree (branch lengths represent genetic distances in substitutions/site). As for the NJ tree,it is not oriented in time: this is an unrooted tree (displayed with a random root in Figtree). You can reroot the tree in Figtree using Y. pseudotuberculosis as an outgroup, as previously.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nCan you confirm the position of our genomes of interest (KZL002, GZL002, CHC004 and VLI092)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nYes. Just as in the NJ tree, they form a clade which is basal to the rest of the Y. pestis diversity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nIs that placement well-supported? (look at the bootstrap support value: click on the “Node Labels” box and open the drop-down menu, change “Node ages” to “bootstrap support”)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe placement is strongly supported as indicated by a bootstrap support of 100% for this clade (it is not very easy to see, you probably need to zoom in a bit)\n\n\n\n\nYou can notice that the phylogeny is difficult to visualize due to the long branch leading to Y. pseudotuberculosis. Having a very distant outgroup can also have deleterious effects on the estimated phylogeny (due to the so-called “long branch attraction” effect). We can construct a new phylogeny after removing the outgroup:\n\ngo back to the original alignment in mega (that we used for the Neighbour Joining tree), untick Y.pseudotuberculosis, and export in fasta format (“Data” -&gt; “Export Data” -&gt; change “Format” to “Fasta” and click “Ok”; you can save it as: “snpAlignment_without_outgroup.fas”)\nrun raxml on this new alignment (change input to “snpAlignment_without_outgroup.fas” and output prefix (-n) to “without_outgroup” in the command line)\nopen the bipartition… file in figtree and reroot the tree based on the knowledge we have gained previously: place the root on the branch leading to the prehistoric Y. pestis strains (KZL002, GZL002, CHC004 and VLI092).\n\n\nLastly, we will export the rooted tree from figtree: File -&gt; Export trees -&gt; select the “save as currently displayed” box and save as “ML_tree_rooted.tre” (this will be useful for the section “Temporal signal assessment” at the end of this tutorial)",

    "text": "15.6 Estimating a time-tree using Bayesian phylogenetics (BEAST2)\nNow, we will try to use reconstruct a phylogeny in which the branch lengths do not represent a number of substitutions but instead represent the time of evolution. To do so, we will use the dates of ancient genomes (C14 dates) to calibrate the tree in time. This assumes a molecular clock hypothesis in which substitutions occur at a rate that is relatively constant in time so that the time of evolution can be estimated based on the number of substitutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA great advantage of ancient pathogen genomes is that they provide key calibration points to estimate molecular clocks and dated phylogenies. This is more difficult to do with modern data alone.\n\n\nWe will estimate a time-tree from our alignment using Bayesian inference as implemented in the BEAST2 software. Bayesian inference is based on a probability distribution that is different from the likelihood: the posterior probability. The posterior probability is the probability of the parameters given the data. It is easier to interpret than the likelihood because it directly contains all the information about the parameters: point estimates such as the median or the mean can be directly estimated from it, but also percentile intervals which can be used to measure uncertainty.\n\nThe Bayes theorem tells us that the posterior probability is proportional to the product of the likelihood and the “prior” probability of the parameters:\n\nTherefore, for Bayesian inference, we need to complement our probabilistic model with prior distributions for all the parameters. Because we want to estimate a time tree, we also add another parameter: the molecular clock (average substitution rate in time units).\n\nTo characterize the full posterior distribution of each parameter, we would need in theory to compute the posterior probability for each possible combination of parameters. This is impossible, and we will instead use an algorithm called Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to approximate the posterior distribution. The MCMC is an algorithm which iteratively samples values of the parameters from the posterior distribution. Therefore, if the MCMC has run long enough, the (marginal) posterior distribution of the parameters can be approximated by a histogram of the sampled values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe “taming the beast” website has great tutorials to learn setting a BEAST2 analysis. In particular, the “Introduction to BEAST2”, “Prior selection” and “Time-stamped data” are good starts.\n\n\nThe different components of the BEAST2 analysis can be set up in the program BEAUti:\n\nOpen BEAUTi by typing beauti & in the terminal (if asked to update, press ‘not now’), and set up an analysis as followed:\n\nload the alignment without outgroup in the “Partitions” tab (“File” -&gt; “Import alignment”; select “nucleotide”)\n\n\n\nset the sampling dates in the “Tip dates” tab:\n\nselect “Use tip dates”\nclick on “Auto-configure” -&gt; “read from file” and select the sample_ages.txt file\nchange “Since some time in the past” to “Before present”\n\n\n\n\nselect the substitution model in the “Site model” tab:\n\nchose a GTR model\nuse 4 Gamma categories for the Gamma site model: this is to account for variations of the substitution rate across sites (site=nucleotide position)\n\n\n\n\nchoose the molecular clock model in the “Clock model” tab:\n\nuse a relaxed clock lognormal model (this is to allow for some variation of the clock rate across branches)\nchange the initial value of the clock rate to 10-4 substitution/site/year (10-4 can be written 1E-4)\n\n\n\n\nchoose the prior distribution of parameters in the “Priors” tab:\n\nuse a Coalescent Bayesian Skyline tree prior\nchange the mean clock prior to a uniform distribution between 1E-6 and 1E-3 subst/site/year\nleave everything else to default\n\n\n\n\nset up the MCMC in the “MCMC” tab:\n\nuse a chain length of 300M\nsample the mono-dimensional parameters and trees every 10,000 iterations (unfold “tracelog” and “treelog” menus and change “log every” to 10,000)\n\n\n\n\nsave the analysis setup as an xml file: “File” -&gt; “Save as”; you can name the file “beast_analysis_Y_pestis.xml”\n\nNow that the analysis is setup, we can run it using BEAST:\n#| eval: false\nbeast beast_analysis_Y_pestis.xml\nOnce the analysis is running two files should have been created and are continuously updated:\n\nthe “snpAlignment_without_outgroup.log” file which contains the values sampled by the MCMC for various mono-dimensional parameters such as the clock rate, as well as other values that are a logged along the MCMC such as the posterior probability and the likelihood.\nthe “snpAlignment_without_outgroup.trees” file which contains the MCMC trees sampled by the MCMC\n\nWhile the analysis is running, you can start reading the next section!\n\n15.6.1 Assessing BEAST2 results\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReminder\n\n\n\nWe are using an MCMC algorithm to sample the posterior distribution of parameters. If the MCMC has run long enough, we can use the sampled parameters to approximate the posterior distribution itself. Therefore, we have to check first that the MCMC chain has run long enough.\n\n\nWe can assess the MCMC sampling using the program Tracer. Tracer can read BEAST log files an generate statistics and plots for each of the sampled parameters. Most importantly, Tracer provides:\n\ntrace plots: show the sampled parameter values along the MCMC run. Trace plots are a very useful MCMC diagnostic tool.\n\n\nThe first thing that one needs to assess is whether the MCMC has passed the so called “burn-in” phase. The MCMC starts with a random set of parameters and will take some time to reach a zone of high posterior probability density. The parameter values that are sampled during this initial phase are usually considered as noise and discarded (by default, tracer discards the first 10% of samples). The burn-in phase can be visualize on trace plots as an initial phase during which the posterior probability of sampled parameters is constantly increasing before reaching a plateau:\n\nOnce the burn-in phase is passed, one can look at the trace plots to assess if the parameters have been sampled correctly and long enough. Usually, when this is the case, the trace should be quite dense and oscillating around a central value (nice trace plots should look like “hairy caterpillars”). In the figure below, the trace on the left doesn’t look good, the one on the right does:\n\n– ESS values: tracer also calculates effective sample sizes (ESS) for each of the sampled parameters. ESSs are estimates of the number of sampled parameter values after correcting for auto-correlation along the MCMC. As a rule of thumb, one usually considers that an MCMC as run long enough if all parameter’s ESS are &gt; 200. Note that if the trace looks like a hairy caterpillar, the corresponding ESS value should be high.\n\n– Parameter estimates: Tracer also provides statistics and plots to explore the posterior distribution of the parameters. These should be considered only if the trace plot and ESS values look fine. In the “Estimates” tab, after selecting the chosen parameter in the left panel, the upper-right panel shows point estimates (mean, median) and measures of uncertainty (95% HPD interval), and the bottom-right panel shows a histogram of the sampled value:\n\nLet’s now load the “snpAlignment_without_outgroup.log” file into Tracer.\nWhile the run is still going, open a new separate terminal, activate the conda environment with conda activate phylogenomics, open tracer with tracer &, and then “File” -&gt; “Import trace file” -&gt; select “snpAlignment_without_outgroup.log”. Note that one can load a BEAST2 log file into tracer even if the analysis is still running. This allows to assess if the MCMC is running correctly or has run long enough before it’s completed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nHas the MCMC run long enough?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have probably let you analysis run for 10-20 mins before looking at the log file, and this is definitely not sufficient: the burnin phase has recently been passed, the trace plots do not look very dense and ESS values are low. It would probably take a few hours for the analysis to complete. Luckily we have run the analysis in advance and saved the log files for you in the “intermediateFiles” folder: “snpAlignment_without_outgroup.log” and “snpAlignment_without_outgroup.trees”\n\n\n\n\nYou can now load the “intermediateFiles/snpAlignment_without_outgroup.log” file into Tracer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nHas the MCMC run long enough?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nYes! The trace plots look good and all ESSs are &gt; 200 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nWhat is your mean estimate of the clock rate (ucld mean)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n~7.10-6 substitution/site/year. Note, however, that this estimate is largely biased since we used a SNP alignment containing only variable positions. In order to get an unbiased estimate of the substitution rate, we should have used the full alignment or account for the number of constant sites by using a “filtered” alignment (see here). In general, this is good practice since not accounting for conserved positions in the alignment can sometimes affect the tree as well (although this should usually be minor, which is why we didn’t bother to do this here).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15.6.2 MCC tree\nSince we are working in a Bayesian framework, we do not obtain a single phylogenetic tree as with Maximum likelihood, but a large set of trees which should be representative of the posterior distribution. In contrast with mono-dimensional parameters, a tree distribution cannot be easily summarized with mean or median estimates. Instead, we need to use specific tree-summarizing techniques. One of the most popular is the maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree, which works as follow:\n\n\nFor any node in any of the sampled trees, compute a posterior support: the proportion of trees in the sample which contain the node\n\n\nSelect the MCC tree: this is the tree in which the product of node posterior supports is the highest\n\n\nCalculate node/branch statistics on the MCC tree: typically, the mean/median estimates and HPD interval of node ages are calculated from the full tree sample and annotated on the MCC tree\n\n\n\nLet’s generate an MCC tree from our tree sample. We can do this using the TreeAnnotator software, which has both a command line and graphical interface. Let’s use the command line here and run the following (using a burn-in of 10%):\n#| eval: false\n treeannotator -burnin 10 intermediateFiles/snpAlignment_without_outgroup.trees snpAlignment_without_outgroup.MCC.tree\nOnce this is completed, we can open the MCC tree (snpAlignment_without_outgroup.MCC.tree) with figtree. Let’s then add a few elements to the plot:\n\n\nTick the “Scale Axis” box, unfold the corresponding menu, and select “Reverse axis” (now the timescale is in years BP)\n\n\nTick the “Node Labels” box, unfold the corresponding menu, and select “Display: posterior”. The posterior support of each node is now displayed. Note that the support value is a proportion (1=100%)\n\n\nTick the “Node Bars” box, unfold the corresponding menu, and select “Display: height_95%_HPD”. The 95% HPD intervals of node ages are now displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nIs the root of the tree consistent with what we found previously?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nYes! The root is placed between our prehistoric strains and the rest of Y. pestis strains. Note that this time we didn’t have to use an outgroup because we estimated a time-tree: the root is identified as the oldest node in the tree.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nWhat is your estimate for the age of the most recent common ancestor of all Y. pestis strains?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n~5800 years BP (HPD 95%: ~8000-4500 years BP)\n\n\n\n\n\n15.6.3 Bonus: Temporal signal assessment\nIt is a good practice to assess if the genetic sequences that we analyse do indeed behave like molecular clocks before trying to estimate a time tree (i.e. we should have done this before the actual BEAST2 analysis). A classic way to assess the temporal signal of a dataset is the root-to-tip regression. The rationale of the root-to-tip regression is to verify that the oldest a sequence is, the closer it should be to the root in a (rooted) substitution tree because there was less time for substitution to accumulate. In other words, their should be a correlation between sample age and distance to the root, which we can assess using a linear regression (root-to-tip regression). This can be done using the program TempEst:\n\nopen TempEst by typing tempest & and load the rooted ML tree that we produced previously (you should have saved it as “ML_tree_rooted.tre”)\nclick on “Import Dates” in the “Sample Dates” tab, select the sample_age.txt file and click “OK”\nstill in the “Sample Dates” tab, change “Since some time in the past” to “Before present” (one might need to extend the TempEst window to see the pull down menu)\nlook at the “Root-to-tip tab”: is there a positive correlation between time and root-to-tip divergence as expected under the molecular clock hypothesis?",

Comparison with a range of previously published data of different preservational levels can allow an estimate on the quality of the new samples. When considering solely (re)using public data, we can consider that this can also spawn new ideas, projects, and meta analyses to allow further deeper exploration of ancient metagenomic data (e.g., looking for correlations between various environmental factors and preservation).\nFortunately for us, geneticists and particularly palaeogenomicists have been very good at uploading raw sequencing data to well-established databases (Anagnostou et al. 2015).\nIn the vast majority of cases you will be able to find publically available sequencing data on the INSDC association of databases, namely the EBI’s European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), and NCBI or DDBJ’s Sequence Read Archives (SRA).

The rest of the page shows a tabular window containing rows and columns corresponding to sample metadata and rows of samples with metadata such as project name, publication year and site name.\n\n\n\nTo navigate, you can scroll down to see more rows, and press shift and scroll to see more columns, or use click on a cell and use your arrow keys (⬆,⬇,⬅,➡) to move around the table.\nYou can reorder columns by clicking on the column name, and also filter by pressing the little ‘burger’ icon that appears on the column header when you hover over a given column.\nAs an exercise, we will try filtering to a particular set of samples, then generate some download scripts, and download the files.\nFirst, filter the project_name column to ‘Muhlemann2020’ from (Kocher et al. 2021, Figure 16.4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.4: The AMDirT viewer with a filter menu coming out of the project name column, with an example search of the project ‘Kocher 2021’ in the search bar.\n\n\n\nThen scroll to the right, and filter the geo_loc_name to ‘Norway’ (Figure 16.5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.5: The AMDirT viewer with a filter menu coming out of the geo location column, with an example search of the country ‘United Kingdom’ written in the search bar and the entry ticked in the results.\n\n\n\nYou should be left with 2 rows.\nFinally, scroll back to the first column and tick the boxes of these four samples (Figure 16.6).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.6: The AMDirT viewer with just four rows with samples from Kocher2021 that are located in the United Kingdom being displayed, and the tickboxes next to each one selected\n\n\n\nOnce you’ve selected the samples you want, you can press Validate selection below the table box. You should then see a series loading-spinner, and new a lot of buttons should appear (Figure 16.7)!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.7: The AMDirT viewer after pressing the ‘validate selection’ button. A range of buttons are displayed at the bottom including a warning message, with the buttons offering download of a range of files such as download scripts, AncientMetagenomeDir library tables and input configuration sheets for a range of ancient DNA bioinformatics pipelines\n\n\n\nYou should have four categories of buttons:\n\nDownload AncientMetagenomeDir Library Table\nDownload Curl sample download script\nDownload &lt;tool/pipeline name&gt; input TSV\nDownload Citations as BibText\n\nThe first button is to download a table containing all the AncientMetagenomeDir metadata of the selected samples. The second is for generating a download script that will allow you to immediately download all sequencing data of the samples you selected. The third set of buttons generate (partially!) pre-configured input files for use in dedicated ancient DNA pipeline such as nf-core/eager (Fellows Yates, Lamnidis, et al. 2021), PALAEOMIX (Schubert et al. 2014), and/or and aMeta (Pochon et al. 2022). Finally, the fourth button generates a text file with (in most cases) all the citations of the data you downloaded, in a format accepted by most reference/citation managers. In this case the reference metadata for that particular publication isn’t publicly available so there is a warning.\nIt’s important to note you are not necessarily restricted to Curl for downloading the data. AMDirT aims to add support for whatever tools or pipelines requested by the community. For example, an already supported downloading tool alternative is the nf-core/fetchNGS pipeline. You can select these using the drop-down menus on the left hand-side.\nFor the next step of this tutorial, we will press the following buttons:\n\nDownload AncientMetagenomeDir Library Table\nDownload Curl sample download script\nDownload nf-core/eager input TSV\nDownload Citations as BibText\n\nYour browser should then download two .tsv files, one .sh file and one .bib file into it’s default location.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDo not worry if you get a ‘Citation information could not be resolved’ warning! This is occasionally expected for some publications due to a CrossRef metadata information problem when requesting reference information about a DOI.\n\n\nOnce this is done, you can close the tab of the web browser, and in the terminal you can press ctrl + c to shutdown the tool.\n\n\n16.4.2 Inspecting AMDirT viewer Output\nLets look at the files that AMDirT has generated for you.\nFirst we should mv our files from the directory that your web browser downloaded the files into into somewhere safer.\nTo start, we make sure we’re still in the chapter’s data directory, and move move the files into it.\n#| eval: false\nmv ~/Downloads/AncientMetagenomeDir_* /&lt;path&gt;/&lt;to&gt;/accessing-ancient-metagenomic-data/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe default download directory normally something like ~/Downloads/), however may vary on your machine!\n\n\nThen we can look inside the chapter’s directory. We should see the following five files\n#| eval: false\nls\nAncientMetagenomeDir_bibliography.bib\nAncientMetagenomeDir_curl_download_script.sh\nAncientMetagenomeDir_filtered_libraries.csv\nAncientMetagenomeDir_nf_core_eager_input_table.tsv\nancientsinglegenome-hostassociated_samples_Muhlemann2020_Norway.tsv\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAMDirT v1.4.6 has a bug where nf-core/mag files will also be generated whenever you download a file\nThese can be ignored, or deleted with the command rm *_mag_*\n\n\nWe can simply run cat of the four files downloaded by AMDirT to look inside (the files starting with AncientMetagenomeDir_). If you run cat on the curl download script, you should see a series of curl commands with the correct ENA links for you for each of the samples you wish to download.\n#| eval: false\ncat AncientMetagenomeDir_curl_download_script.sh\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\ncurl -L ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR409/005/ERR4093845/ERR4093845.fastq.gz -o ERR4093845.fastq.gz\ncurl -L ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR409/008/ERR4093838/ERR4093838.fastq.gz -o ERR4093838.fastq.gz\ncurl -L ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR409/000/ERR4093860/ERR4093860_2.fastq.gz -o ERR4093860_2.fastq.gz\ncurl -L ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR409/006/ERR4093846/ERR4093846.fastq.gz -o ERR4093846.fastq.gz\ncurl -L ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR409/009/ERR4093839/ERR4093839.fastq.gz -o ERR4093839.fastq.gz\ncurl -L ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR409/000/ERR4093860/ERR4093860_1.fastq.gz -o ERR4093860_1.fastq.gz\ncurl -L ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR409/007/ERR4093847/ERR4093847.fastq.gz -o ERR4093847.fastq.gz\nBy providing this script for you, AMDirT facilitates fast download of files of interest by replacing the one-by-one download commands for each sample with a single command!\n#| eval: false\nbash AncientMetagenomeDir_curl_download_script.sh\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100 4042k  100 4042k    0     0  3925k      0  0:00:01  0:00:01 --:--:-- 3928k\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100 7749k  100 7749k    0     0  6487k      0  0:00:01  0:00:01 --:--:-- 6490k\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100  980k  100  980k    0     0  1140k      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 1140k\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100 5346k  100 5346k    0     0  4777k      0  0:00:01  0:00:01 --:--:-- 4774k\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100 8671k  100 8671k    0     0  6794k      0  0:00:01  0:00:01 --:--:-- 6801k\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100  836k  100  836k    0     0   995k      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  994k\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100 2799k  100 2799k    0     0  2816k      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 2816k\nRunning this command should result in progress logs of the downloading of the data of the four selected samples!\nWe can check the output by running ls to verify we have seven FASTQ files (five single end, and one paired end libraries).\nOnce the four samples are downloaded, AMDirT then facilitates fast processing of the data, as the eager script can be given directly to nf-core/eager as input. Importantly by including the library metadata (mentioned above), researchers can leverage the complex automated processing that nf-core/eager can perform when given such relevant metadata.\n#| eval: false\ncat AncientMetagenomeDir_nf_core_eager_input_table.tsv\nSample_Name Library_ID  Lane    Colour_Chemistry    SeqType Organism    Strandedness    UDG_Treatment   R1  R2  BAM\nVK388   ERR4093838  0   4   SE  Homo sapiens    double  none    ERR4093838.fastq.gz NA  NA\nVK388   ERR4093839  0   4   SE  Homo sapiens    double  none    ERR4093839.fastq.gz NA  NA\nVK515   ERR4093845  0   4   SE  Homo sapiens    double  none    ERR4093845.fastq.gz NA  NA\nVK515   ERR4093846  0   2   SE  Homo sapiens    double  none    ERR4093846.fastq.gz NA  NA\nVK515   ERR4093847  0   4   SE  Homo sapiens    double  none    ERR4093847.fastq.gz NA  NA\nVK515   ERR4093860  0   2   PE  Homo sapiens    double  none    ERR4093860_1.fastq.gz   ERR4093860_2.fastq.gz   NA\nFinally, we can look into the BibTeX citations file (*bib) which will provide you with the citation information of all the downloaded data and AncientMetagenomeDir itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe contents of this file is reliant on indexing of publications on CrossRef.

The community curates all new submissions to the repository, and this all occurs with Git and GitHub.\nThe data is hosted and maintained on GitHub - new publications are evaluated on issues, submissions created on branches, made by pull requests, and PRs reviewed by other members of the community.\nYou can see the workflow in the image below from the AncientMetagenomeDir publication, and read more about the workflow on the AncientMetagenomeDir wiki.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.8: Overview of the AncientMetagenomeDir contribution workflow. Potential publications are added as a GitHub issue where they undergo relevance evaluation. Once approved, a contributor makes a branch on the AncientMetagenomeDir GitHub repository, adds the new lines of metadata for the relevant samples and libraries, and once ready opens a pull request against the main repository. The pull request undergoes an automated consistent check against a schema and then undergoes a human-based peer review for accuracy against AncientMetagenomeDir guidelines. Once approved, the pull request is merged, and periodically the dataset is released on GitHub and automatically archived on Zenodo.\n\n\n\nAs AncientMetagenomeDir is on GitHub, the means we can also use this repository to try out our Git skills we learnt in the chapter Introduction to Git(Hub)!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nYour task is to complete the following steps however with git terms removed (indicated by quotes).

    "section": "17.2 Workflow managers",
    "text": "17.2 Workflow managers\nAll the pipelines introduced in this chapter utilise workflow managers. These are software that allows users to ‘chain’ together the inputs and outputs distinct ‘atomic’ steps of a bioinformatics analysis - e.g. separate terminal commands of different bioinformatic tools, so that ‘you don’t have to’. You have already seen very basic workflows or ‘pipelines’ when using the bash ‘pipe’ (|) in the Introduction to the Command Line chapter, where the each row of text the output of one command was ‘streamed’ into the next command.\nHowever in the case of bioinformatics, we are often dealing with non-row based text files, meaning that ‘classic’ command line pipelines don’t really work. Instead this is where bioinformatic workflow managers come in: they handle the passing of files from one tool to the next but in a reproducible manager.\nModern computational bioinformatic workflow managers focus on a few main concepts. To summarise Wratten, Wilm, and Göke (2021), these areas are: data provenance, portability, scalability, re-entrancy - all together which contribute to ensuring reproducibility of bioinformatic analyses. Data provenance refers to the ability to track and visualise where each file goes and gets processed, as well as metadata about each file and process (e.g., What version of a tool was used? What parameters were used in that step? How much computing resources were used). Portability follows from data provenance where it’s not just can the entire execution of the pipeline be reconstructed - but can it also be run with the same results on a different machine? This is important to ensure that you can install and test the pipeline on your laptop, but when you then need to do heavy computation using real data, that it will still be able to execute on a high-performance computing cluster (HPC) or on the cloud - both that have very different configurations. This is normally achieved through the use of reusable software environments such as as conda or container engines such as docker, and tight integration with HPC schedulers such as SLURM. As mentioned earlier, not having to run each command manually can be a great speed up to your analysis. However this needs to be able to be Scalable that it the workflow is still efficient regardless whether you’re running with one or ten thousands samples - modern workflow managers perform resource requirement optimisation and scheduling to ensure that all steps of the pipeline will be executed in the most resource efficient manner so it completes as fast as possible - but regardless of of the number of input data. Finally, as workflows get bigger and longer, re-entrancy has become more important, i.e., the ability to re-start a pipeline run that got stuck halfway through due to an error.\nAll workflow managers have different ways of implementing the concepts above, and these can be very simple (e.g. Makefiles) to very powerful and abstract (e.g. Workflow Description Language). In this chapter we will use pipelines that use two popular workflow managers in bioinformatics, Nextflow and Snakemake.\nThis chapter will not cover how to write your own workflow, as this would require a whole other textbook. However it is recommended to learn and use workflow managers when carrying out repetitive or routine bioinformatic analysis (Nextflow and snakemake being two popular ones in bioinformatics). Use of workflow managers can help make your work more efficiently (as you only run one command, rather than each step separately), but also more reproducible by reducing the risk of user error when executing each step: the computer will do exactly what you tell it, and if you don’t change anything, will do the exact same thing every time. If you’re interested in writing your own workflows using workflow managers, many training and tutorials exist on the internet (e.g., for Nextflow there is the official training or from software carpentries, or the official training for snakemake.",

    "section": "17.3 What is nf-core/eager?",
    "text": "17.3 What is nf-core/eager?\nnf-core/eager is a computational pipeline specifically designed for preprocessing and analysis of ancient DNA data (Figure 17.1). It is a reimplementation of the previously published EAGER (Efficient Ancient Genome Reconstruction) pipeline (Peltzer et al. 2016) written in the workflow manager Nextflow. In addition to reimplementing the original genome mapping and variant calling pipeline, in a more reproducible and portable manner the pipeline also included additional new functionality particularly for researchers interested in microbial sciences, namely a dedicated genotyper and consensus caller designed for low coverage genomes, the ability to get breadth and depth coverage statistics for particular genomic features (e.g. virulence genes), but also automated metagenomic screening and authentication of the off-target reads from mapping (e.g. against the host reference genome).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.1: nf-core/eager workflow summary in the form of a ‘metro map’ style diagram. FASTQ or BAM input for red and yellow lines (representing eukaryotic and prokaryotic workflows) goes through FastQC, Adapter Removal, alignment to a reference FASTA input with a range of alignments, before going through BAM filtering, deduplication, in silico damage removal, and variant calling. Multiple statistics steps come out of the deduplication ‘station’. The blue line represents the metagenomic workflow, where offtarget reads come out of the BAM filtering ‘station’, and goes through compexity filtering with BBDuk, MALT or Kraken2, and optionally into MaltExtract for MALT output.\n\n\n\nA detailed description of steps in the pipeline is available as part of nf-core/eager’s extensive documentation. For more information, check out the usage documentation here.\nBriefly, nf-core/eager takes at a minimum standard input file types that are shared across the genomics field, i.e., raw FASTQ files or aligned reads in bam format, and a reference fasta. nf-core/eager performs preprocessing of this raw data, including adapter clipping, read merging, and quality control of adapter-trimmed data. nf-core/eager then carries mapping using a variety of field-standard shot-read alignment tools with default parameters adapted for short and damaged aDNA sequences. The off-target reads from host DNA mapping can then go into metagenomic classification and authentication (in the case of MALT). After genomic mapping, BAM files go through deduplication of PCR duplicates, damage profiling and removal, and finally variant calling. A myriad of additional statistics can be generated depending on the users preference. Finally, nf-core eager uses MultiQC to create an integrated html report that summarizes the output/results from each of the pipeline steps.\n\n17.3.1 Running nf-core/eager\nFor the practical portion of this chapter, we will utilize sequencing data from four aDNA libraries, which you should have already downloaded from NCBI. If not, please see the Preparation section above . We will use nf-core/eager to perform a typical microbial genomic analysis, i.e., reconstruction of an ancient genome to generate variant calls that can be used for generating phylogenomic trees and other evolutionary analysis, and gene feature coverage statistics to allow insight into the functional aspects of the genome.\nThese four libraries come from from two ancient individuals, GLZ002 and KZL002. GLZ002 comes from the Neolithic Siberian site of Glazkovskoe predmestie (Yu et al. 2020) and was radiocarbon dated to 3081-2913 calBCE. KZL002 is an Iron Age individual from Kazakhstan, radiocarbon dated to 2736-2457 calBCE (Andrades Valtueña et al. 2022). Both individuals were originally analysed for human population genetic analysis, but when undergoing metagenomic screening of the off-target reads, both set of authors identified reads from Yersinia pestis from these individuals - the bacterium that causes plague. Subsequently the libraries from these individuals were processed using hybridization capture to increase the number of Y. pestis sequences available for analysis.\nOur aims in the following tutorial are to:\n\nPreprocess the FASTQ files by trimming adapters and merging paired-end reads\nAlign reads to the Y. pestis reference and compute the endogenous DNA percentage\nFilter the aligned reads to remove host DNA\nRemove duplicate reads for accurate coverage estimation and genotyping\nGenerate statistics on gene features (e.g. virulence factors)\nMerge data by sample and perform genotyping on the combined dataset\nReview quality control data to evaluate the success of the previous steps\n\nLet’s get started!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nnf-core/eager v2 requires an older version of Nextflow - if installing manually, ensure you do not have Nextflow version any greater than v22.10.6!\n\n\nFirst, download the latest version of the nf-core/eager repo (or check for updates if you have a previously-installed version):\n#| eval: false\nnextflow pull nf-core/eager\nNext we can re-visit AMDirT (see Accessing Ancient Metagenomic Data) to download a pre-prepared configuration file for nf-core/eager\n\nLoad AMDirt (AMDirT viewer), and select the latest release and the ‘ancientsinglegenome-hostassociated’ table\nFilter the sample_name column to just show KZL002 and GLZ002, and select these two rows\n\nPress the burger icon on the column\nPress the filter tab and deselect everything\nSearch GLZ002 and select in filter menu\nSearch KZL002 and select in filter menu\nClose filter menu and select the two rows\n\nPress the Validate Selection button\nPress the ‘Download Curl sample download script’, ‘Download nf-core/eager input TSV’, and ‘Download Citations as BibTex’ buttons\nMove the downloaded files into eager/ of this tutorial’s directory\n\ni.e., if the files were downloaded to you Downloads/ folder rather than the chapters directory,\ne.g., assuming you’ve got no other previous downloads you can run mv ~/Downloads/AncientMetagenomeDir_* eager/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWe won’t actually use the BibTex citations file for anything in this tutorial, but it is good habit to always to record and save all citations of any software or data you use!\n\n\nTo download the FASTQ files\n\nMove into the eager/ directory\nRun bash AncientMetagenomeDir_curl_download_script.sh to download the files (this may take ~3 minutes)\n\nNext we now inspect the AMDirT generated input TSV file for nf-core/eager!\n#| eval: false\ncat AncientMetagenomeDir_nf_core_eager_input_table.tsv\nSample_Name Library_ID  Lane    Colour_Chemistry    SeqType Organism    Strandedness    UDG_Treatment   R1  R2  BAM\nGLZ002  ERR4093961  0   4   PE  Homo sapiens    double  half    ERR4093961_1.fastq.gz   ERR4093961_2.fastq.gz   NA\nGLZ002  ERR4093962  0   4   PE  Homo sapiens    double  full    ERR4093962_1.fastq.gz   ERR4093962_2.fastq.gz   NA\nKZL002  ERR8958768  0   4   PE  Homo sapiens    double  half    ERR8958768_1.fastq.gz   ERR8958768_2.fastq.gz   NA\nKZL002  ERR8958769  0   4   PE  Homo sapiens    double  half    ERR8958769_1.fastq.gz   ERR8958769_2.fastq.gz   NA\nHere we see 10 columns, all pre-filled. The first two columns correspond to sample/library IDs that will be used for data provenance and grouping. When you have sequencing multiple lanes you can speed up preprocessing these independently before merging, so lane can specify this (although not used in this case as we have independent libraries per sample. You can indicate the colour chemistry to indicate whether your data requires additional pre-processing to remove poly-G tails, and then also strandedness and UDG damage treatment status of the libraries if you require further damage manipulation. Finally you provide paths to the FASTQ files or BAM files\nOther than the raw FASTQ files, we will need a reference genome and annotation coordinates of genes present on the genome. In this case you will use a Yersinia pestis (accession: GCF_001293415.1) reference genome (.fna) and gene feature file (.gff) from NCBI Genome.\nThese have already been placed in the reference/ directory for you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf guided: reference download and preparation\n\n\n\n\n\nTo download the required reference genome and annotation file run the following command to download from the NCBI Genome database.\n#| eval: false\n## Download from NCBI\ncurl -OJX GET \"https://api.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/v2alpha/genome/accession/GCF_001293415.1/download?include_annotation_type=GENOME_FASTA,GENOME_GFF,RNA_FASTA,CDS_FASTA,PROT_FASTA,SEQUENCE_REPORT&filename=GCF_001293415.1.zip\" -H \"Accept: application/zip\"\n\nunzip *.zip\nmv ncbi_dataset/data/GCF_001293415.1/* .\n\n## We have to sort the gff file to make it eager compatible\ngffread genomic.gff GCF_001293415.1_ASM129341v1_genomic.gff\n\n\n\nWith all of these, we can run the pipeline!\nFirst lets enter a screen session to make sure we can leave the pipeline running in the background and continue using our terminal.\n#| eval: false\nscreen -R eager\nconda activate ancient-metagenomic-pipelines\nNow we can construct an eager command from within the data/ directory so that it looks like this:\n#| eval: false\nnextflow run nf-core/eager -r 2.4.7 \\\n-profile docker \\\n--fasta ../reference/GCF_001293415.1_ASM129341v1_genomic.fna \\\n--input AncientMetagenomeDir_nf_core_eager_input_table.tsv \\\n--anno_file ../reference/GCF_001293415.1_ASM129341v1_genomic.gff \\\n--run_bam_filtering --bam_unmapped_type discard \\\n--skip_preseq \\\n--run_genotyping --genotyping_tool ug --gatk_ug_out_mode EMIT_ALL_SITES \\\n--run_bcftools_stats --run_bedtools_coverage\nWhen the run starts, you see a long list of process lines with progress bars slowly appearing over time. If you press ctrl + a and then [ to access a ‘navigation’ (called ‘copy’) mode, then use your arrow keys on your keyboard to scroll up and down. To quit this mode just press q.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWe don’t normally recommend running analyses in the directory your data is in! It is better to keep data and analysis results in separate directories. Here we are just running eager alongside the data for convenience (i.e., you don’t have to modify the downloaded input TSV)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThis run will take between 20m-40m to run on a standard laptop! Time for a break, or you can continue reading this chapter as the critical output data has already been provided for you in the data directory.\n\n\nSo what is this command doing? The different parameters do the following:\n\nTell nextflow to run the nf-core/eager pipeline with version 2.4.7\nSpecify which computing and software environment to use with -profile\n\nIn this case we are running locally so we don’t specify a computing environment (such as a configuration for an institutional HPC)\nWe use docker as our container engine, which downloads all the software and specific versions needed for nf-core/eager in immutable ‘containers’, to ensure nothing get broken and is as nf-core/eager expects\n\nProvide the various paths to the input files (TSV with paths to FASTQ files, a reference fasta, and the reference fasta’s annotations)\nActivate the various of the steps of the pipeline you’re interested in\n\nWe turn off preseq (e.g. when you know you can’t sequence more)\nWe want to turn on BAM filtering, and specify to generate unmapped reads in FASTQ file (so you could check off target reads e.g. for other pathogens)\nYou turn on genotyping using GATK UnifiedGenotyper (preferred over HaplotypeCaller due to in compatibiity with that method to low-coverage data)\nWe turn on variant statistics (from GATK) using bcftools, and coverage statistics of gene features using bedtools\n\n\nFor full parameter documentation, click here.\nAnd now we wait… \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAs a reminder, to detach from the screen session type ctrl + a then d. To reattach screen -r eager\n\n\nSpecifically for ancient (meta)genomic data, the following parameters and options may be useful to consider when running your own data:\n\n--mapper circularmapper:\n\nThis aligner is a variant of bwa aln that allows even mapping across the end of linear references of circular genomes\nAllows reads spanning the start/end of the sequence to be correctly placed, and this provides better coverage estimates across the entire genome\n\n--hostremoval_input_fastq:\n\nAllows re-generation of input FASTQ files but with any reads aligned to the reference genome removed\nCan be useful when dealing with modern or ancient data where there are ethical restrictions on the publication of host DNA\nThe output can be used as ‘raw data’ upload to public data repositories\n\n--run_bam_filtering --bam_unmapped_type:\n\nA pre-requisite for performing the metagenomic analysis steps of nf-core/eager\nGenerates FASTQ files off the unmapped reads present in the reference mapping BAM file\n\n--run_bedtools_coverage --anno_file /&lt;path&gt;/&lt;to&gt;/&lt;genefeature&gt;.bed\n\nTurns on calculating depth/breadth of annotations in the provided bed or GFF file, useful for generating e.g. virulence gene presence/absence plots\n\n--run_genotyping --genotyping_tool ug --gatk_ug_out_mode EMIT_ALL_SITES\n\nTurns on genotyping with GATK UnifiedGenotyper\nA pre-requisite for running MultiVCFAnalyzer for consensus sequencing creation\nIt’s recommend to use either GATK UnifiedGenotyper or freeBayes (non-MultiVCFAnalyzer compatible!) for low-coverage data\nGATK HaplotypeCaller is not recommended for low coverage data as it performs local de novo assembly around possible variant sites, and this will fail with low-coverage short-read data\n\n--run_multivcfanalyzer --write_allele_frequencies\n\nTurns on SNP table and FASTA consensus sequence generation with MultiVCFAnalyzer (see pre-requisites above)\nBy providing --write_allele_frequencies, the SNP table will also provide the percentage of reads at that position supporting the call. This can help you evaluate the level of cross-mapping from related (e.g. contaminating environmental) species and may question the reliablity of any resulting downstream analyses.\n\n--metagenomic_complexity_filtering\n\nAn additional preprocessing step of raw reads before going into metagenomic screening to remove low-complexity reads (e.g. mono- or di-nucleotide repeats)\nRemoving these will speed up and lower computational requirements during classification, and will not bias profiles as these sequences provide no taxon-specific information (i.e., can be aligned against thousands to millions of genomes)\n\n--run_metagenomic_screening\n\nTurns on metagenomic screening with either MALT or Kraken2\nIf running with MALT, can supply --run_maltextract to get authentication statistics and plots (damage, read lengths etc.) for evaluation.\n\n\n\n\n17.3.2 Top Tips for nf-core/eager success\n\nScreen sessions\nDepending on the size of your input data, infrastructure, and analyses, running nf-core/eager can take hours or even days (e.g. the example command above will likely take around 20 minutes!). To avoid crashes due to loss of power or network connectivity, try running nf-core/eager in a screen or tmux session:\n#| eval: false\nscreen -R eager\nMultiple ways to supply input data\nIn this tutorial, a tsv file to specify our input data files and formats. This is a powerful approach that allows nf-core eager to intelligently apply analyses to certain files only (e.g. merging for paired-end but not single-end libraries). However inputs can also be specified using wildcards, which can be useful for fast analyses with simple input data types (e.g. same sequencing configuration, file location, etc.).\nSee the online nf-core/eager documentation for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExampl commands - do not run!\n\n\n\n#| eval: false\nnextflow run nf-core/eager -r 2.4.7 -profile docker --fasta ../reference/GCF_001293415.1_ASM129341v1_genomic.fna \\\n--input \"data/*_{1,2}.fastq.gz\" &lt;...&gt; \\\n--udg_type half\n\n\n\nGet your MultiQC report via email\nIf you have GNU mail or sendmail set up on your system, you can add the following flag to send the MultiQC html to your email upon run completion:\n--email \"your_address@something.com\"\nCheck out the EAGER GUI\nFor researchers who might be less comfortable with the command line, check out the nf-core/eager launch GUI! The GUI also provides a full list of all pipeline options with short explanations for those interested in learning more about what the pipeline can do.\nWhen something fails, all is not lost!\nWhen individual jobs fail, nf-core/eager will try to automatically resubmit that job with increased memory and CPUs (up to two times per job).\nWhen the whole pipeline crashes, you can save time and computational resources by resubmitting with the -resume flag. nf-core/eager will retrieve cached results from previous steps as long as the input is the same.\nMonitor your pipeline in real time with the Nextflow Tower\nRegular users may be interested in checking out the Nextflow Tower, a tool for monitoring the progress of Nextflow pipelines in real time. Check here for more information.\n\n\n\n17.3.3 nf-core/eager output\n\n17.3.3.1 Results files\nOnce completed, the results/ directory of your nf-core/eager run will contain a range of directories that will have output files and tool logs of all the steps of the pipeline. nf-core/eager tries to only save the ‘useful’ files.\nEveryday useful files for ancient (microbial) (meta)genomics typically are in folders such as:\n\ndeduplication/ or merged_bams\n\nThese contain the most basic BAM files you would want to use for downstream analyses (and used in the rest of the genomic workflow of the pipeline)\nThey contain deduplicated BAM files (i.e., with PCR artefacts removed)\nmerged_bams/\n\nThis directory will contain BAMs where multiple libraries of one sample have been merged into one final BAM file, when these have been supplied\n\n\ndamage_rescaling/ or trimmed bam/\n\nThese contain the output BAM files from in silico damage removal, if you have turned on e.g. BAM trimming or damage rescaling\nIf you have multiple libraries of one sample, the final BAMs you want will be in merged_bams/\n\ngenotyping/\n\nThis directory will contain your final VCF files from the genotyping step, e.g. from the GATK or freeBayes tools\n\nMultiVCFAnalyzer/\n\nThis will contain consensus sequences and SNP tables from MultiVCFAnalyzer, which also allows generation of ‘multi-allelic’ SNP position statistics (useful for the evaluation of cross-mapping from contaminants or relatives)\n\nbedtools/\n\nThis directory will contain the depth and breadth statistics of genomic features if a gff or bed file has been provided to the pipeline\nThe files can be used to generate gene heatmaps, that can be used to visualise a comparative presence/absence of virulence factor across genomes (e.g. for microbial pathogens)\n\nmetagenomic_classification or malt_extract\n\nThis directory contains the output RMA6 files from MALT, the profiles and taxon count tables from Kraken2, or the aDNA authentication output statistics from maltExtract.\n\n\nMost other folders contain either intermediate files that are only useful for technical evaluation in the case of problems, or statistics files that are otherwise summarised in the run report.\nSo, before you delve into these folders, it’s normally a good idea to do a ‘quality check’ of the pipeline run. You can do this using the interactive MultiQC pipeline run report.\n\n\n17.3.3.2 MultiQC General Statistics\n#| eval: false\ncd multiqc/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you’re impatient, and your nf-core/eager run hasn’t finished yet, you can cancel the run with ctrl + c (possibly a couple of times), and you can open a premade file in the data directory under ancient-metagenomic-pipelines/multiqc_report.html\n\n\nIn here you should see a bunch of files, but you should open the multiqc_report.html file in your browser. You can either do this via the commandline (e.g. for firefox firefox multiqc_report.html) or navigate to the file using your file browser and double clicking on the HTML file.\nOnce opened you will see a table, and below it many figures and other tables (Figure 17.2). All of these statistics can help you evaluate the quality of your data, pipeline run, and also possibly some initial results!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.2: Screenshot of initial view of a MultiQC report. The left hand sidebar provides links to various sections of the report, most of them containing summary images of the outputs of all the different tools. On the main panel you see the MultiQC and nf-core/eager logos, some descriptive information about how the report was generated, and finally the top of the ‘General Statistics’ tables, that has columns such as Sample Name, Nr. Input reads, length of input reads, %trimmed, etc. Each numeric column contains a coloured barchart to help readers to quickly evaluate the number of a given sample against all others in the table\n\n\n\nTypically you will look at the General Statistics table to get a rough overview of the pipeline run. If you hover your cursor over the column headers, you can see which tool the column’s numbers came from, however generally the columns go in order of left to right, where the left most columns are from earlier in the pipeline run (e.g. removing adapters), to variant calling statistics (e.g. number of variants called). You can also configure which columns to display using the Configure columns button. It’s important to note that in MultiQC tables, you may have duplicate rows from the same library or sample. This is due to MultiQC trying to squish in as many statistics from as many steps of the pipeline as possible (for example, statistics on each of a pair of FASTQ files, and then statistics on the single merged and mapped BAM file), so you should play around with the column configuration to help you visualise the best way to initially evaluate your data.\nThe bulk of the MultiQC report is made up of per-tool summary plots (e.g., barcharts, linecharts etc). Most of these will be interactive, i.e. you can hover over lines and bars to get more specific numbers of each plot. However the visualisations are aimed at helping you identify possible outliers that may represent failed samples or libraries.\nEvaluating how good the data is and how well the run went will vary depending on the dataset and the options selected. However the nf-core/eager tutorials have a good overview of questions you can ask from your MultiQC report to see whether your data is good or not. We shamelessly copy these questions here (as the overlap authors of both the the nf-core/eager documentation and this text book is rather high).\nOnce completed, you can try going through the MultiQC report the command you executed above, and compare against the questions below. Keep in mind you have a sample N of two, so many of the questions in regards to identifying ‘outliers’ may be difficult.\nThe following questions are by no means comprehensive, but rather represent the ‘typical’ questions the nf-core/eager developers asked of their own data and reports. However they can act as a good framework for thinking critically about your own results.\n\n17.3.3.2.1 General Stats Table\n\nDo I see the expected number of raw sequencing reads (summed across each set of FASTQ files per library) that was requested for sequencing?\nDoes the percentage of trimmed reads look normal for aDNA, and do lengths after trimming look short as expected of aDNA?\nDoes the Endogenous DNA (%) columns look reasonable (high enough to indicate you have received enough coverage for downstream, and/or do you lose an unusually high reads after filtering )\nDoes ClusterFactor or ‘% Dups’ look high (e.g. &gt;2 or &gt;10% respectively - high values suggesting over-amplified or badly preserved samples i.e. low complexity; note that genome-enrichment libraries may by their nature look higher).\nDo you see an increased frequency of C&gt;Ts on the 5’ end of molecules in the mapped reads?\nDo median read lengths look relatively low (normally &lt;= 100 bp) indicating typically fragmented aDNA?\nDoes the % coverage decrease relatively gradually at each depth coverage, and does not drop extremely drastically\nDoes the Median coverage and percent &gt;3x (or whatever you set) show sufficient coverage for reliable SNP calls and that a good proportion of the genome is covered indicating you have the right reference genome?\nDo you see a high proportion of % Hets, indicating many multi-allelic sites (and possibly presence of cross-mapping from other species, that may lead to false positive or less confident SNP calls)?\n\n\n\n17.3.3.2.2 FastQC (pre-AdapterRemoval)\n\nDo I see any very early drop off of sequence quality scores suggesting problematic sequencing run?\nDo I see outlier GC content distributions?\nDo I see high sequence duplication levels?\n\n\n\n17.3.3.2.3 AdapterRemoval\n\nDo I see high numbers of singletons or discarded read pairs?\n\n\n\n17.3.3.2.4 FastQC (post-AdapterRemoval)\n\nDo I see improved sequence quality scores along the length of reads?\nDo I see reduced adapter content levels?\n\n\n\n17.3.3.2.5 Samtools Flagstat (pre/post Filter)\n\nDo I see outliers, e.g. with unusually low levels of mapped reads, (indicative of badly preserved samples) that require downstream closer assessment?\n\n\n\n17.3.3.2.6 DeDup/Picard MarkDuplicates\n\nDo I see large numbers of duplicates being removed, possibly indicating over-amplified or badly preserved samples?\n\n\n\n17.3.3.2.7 MALT (metagenomics only)\n\nDo I have a reasonable level of mappability?\n\nSomewhere between 10-30% can be pretty normal for aDNA, whereas e.g. &lt;1% requires careful manual assessment\n\nDo I have a reasonable taxonomic assignment success?\n\nYou hope to have a large number of the mapped reads (from the mappability plot) that also have taxonomic assignment.\n\n\n\n\n17.3.3.2.8 PreSeq (genomics only)\n\nDo I see a large drop off of a sample’s curve away from the theoretical complexity? If so, this may indicate it’s not worth performing deeper sequencing as you will get few unique reads (vs. duplicates that are not any more informative than the reads you’ve already sequenced)\n\n\n\n17.3.3.2.9 DamageProfiler (genomics only)\n\nDo I see evidence of damage on the microbial DNA (i.e. a % C&gt;T of more than ~5% in the first few nucleotide positions?) ? If not, possibly your mapped reads are deriving from modern contamination.\n\n\n\n17.3.3.2.10 QualiMap (genomics only)\n\nDo you see a peak of coverage (X) at a good level, e.g. &gt;= 3x, indicating sufficient coverage for reliable SNP calls?\n\n\n\n17.3.3.2.11 MultiVCFAnalyzer (genomics only)\n\nDo I have a good number of called SNPs that suggest the samples have genomes with sufficient nucleotide diversity to inform phylogenetic analysis?\nDo you have a large number of discarded SNP calls?\nAre the % Hets very high indicating possible cross-mapping from off-target organisms that may confounding variant calling?\n\nAs above evaluating these outputs will vary depending on the data and or pipeline settings, and very much. However the extensive output documentation of nf-core/eager can guide you through every single table and plot to assist you in continuing any type of ancient DNA project, assisted by fun little cartoony schematic diagrams (Figure 17.3)!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.3: Example of cartoon schematic diagram of the output from DamageProfiler in different contexts. The six panels show different types of ancient DNA damage line-plots from having no damage (flat red/blue lines), however with a speech bubble noting that if the library was UDG treated, that the flat lines might be valid, all the way to the ‘classic’ ancient DNA damage plot with both red and blue lines showing an exponential decay from the ends of reads to the middle, with a motivational speech bubble.

    "text": "17.4 What is aMeta?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFor this chapter’s exercises, if not already performed, you will need to create the conda environment from the following yml file, and activate the environment:\n#| eval: false\nconda activate aMeta\n\n\nWhile nf-core/eager is a solid pipeline for microbial genomics, and can also perform metagenomic screening via the integrated HOPS pipeline or Kraken2, in some cases you may wish to have a more accurate and resource efficient pipeline In this section, we will demonstrate an example of using aMeta, a snakemake workflow proposed by Pochon et al. (2022) that aims to minimise resource usage by combining both low-resource requiring k-mer based taxonomic profiling as well as accurate read-alignment (Figure 17.5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.4: Schematic diagram of the aMeta pipeline. Input samples initially undergo generalised screening using the K-mer based KrakenUniq. For every hit that the reads match inside this database, then sees the genome of that hit then constructed into a MALT database where the reads undergo a mapping step to generate alignments, a lowest-common-ancestor (LCA) algorithm step to refine taxonomic assignments, and ancient DNA authentication statistics generation\n\n\n\nRather than the very computationally heavy HOPS pipeline (Hübler et al. 2019), that requires extremely large computational nodes with large RAM (&gt;1 TB) to load MALT databases into memory, aMeta does this via a two step approach. Firstly it uses KrakenUniq (a k-mer based and thus memory efficient method) to do a screening of sequencing reads against a broad generalised microbial database. Once all the possible taxa have been detected, aMeta will then make a new database of just the genomes of the taxa that were reported from KrakenUniq (i.e. a specific database) but using MALT. MALT on thus much reduced database is then used to perform computationally much heavier alignment against the reference genomes and LCA taxonomic reassignment. The output from MALT is then sent to the MaltExtract program of the HOPS pipeline for ancient DNA authentication statistics.\n\n17.4.1 Running aMeta\nIn this tutorial we will try running the small test data that comes with aMeta.\naMeta has been written in Snakemake, which means running the pipeline has to be installed in a slightly different manner to the nextflow pull command that can be used for nf-core/eager.\n#| eval: false\ncd /&lt;path&gt;/&lt;to&gt;/ancient-metagenomic-pipelines/aMeta\nAs aMeta also includes tools that normally require very large computational resources that cannot fit on a standard laptop, we will instead try to re-use the internal very small ‘fake’ data the aMeta developers use to test the pipeline.\nYou don’t have to worry about trying to understand what the following commands are doing, they will not be important for the rest of the chapter. However generally the commands try to pull all the relevant software (via conda), make a fake database and download other required files, and then reconstruct the basic directory and file structure required for running the pipeline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe next steps, particularly the set up conda envs will take a very long time!\nIf you are impatient, you can speed this process up by using mamba rather than conda.\n#| eval: false\n## Download installation script and run\nwget https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh\nbash Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh\n\n## When asked: Accept the license\n## When asked: Press 'y' to run conda init\n\n## Turn off base\nconda config --set auto_activate_base false\n\n## Re-add original conda environments to be recognised by mamba\nconda config --append envs_dirs /home/ubuntu/bin/miniconda3/envs/\n\n\n#| eval: false\n## Change into ~/.test to set up all the required test resources (Databases etc.)\ncd ~/.test\n\n## Set up conda envs\n## If you can an error about a 'non-default solver backend' the run `conda config --set solver classic` and re-start the command\n## If you have installed the standalone mamba, change --conda-frontend to mamba\nsnakemake --use-conda --show-failed-logs -j 2 --conda-cleanup-pkgs cache --conda-create-envs-only -s ../workflow/Snakefile --conda-frontend conda\nsource $(dirname $(dirname $CONDA_EXE))/etc/profile.d/conda.sh\n\n## If you had to change the solver back to classic, you can switch to libmamba with `conda config --set solver libmamba`\n\n## Build dummy KrakenUniq database\nenv=$(grep krakenuniq .snakemake/conda/*yaml | awk '{print $1}' | sed -e \"s/.yaml://g\")\nconda activate $env\nkrakenuniq-build --db resources/KrakenUniq_DB --kmer-len 21 --minimizer-len 11 --jellyfish-bin $(pwd)/$env/bin/jellyfish\nconda deactivate\n\n## Get Krona taxonomy tax dump\nenv=$(grep krona .snakemake/conda/*yaml | awk '{print $1}' | sed -e \"s/.yaml://g\" | head -1)\nconda activate $env\ncd $env/opt/krona\n./updateTaxonomy.sh taxonomy\ncd -\nconda deactivate\n\n## Adjust malt max memory usage\nenv=$(grep hops .snakemake/conda/*yaml | awk '{print $1}' | sed -e \"s/.yaml://g\" | head -1)\nconda activate $env\nversion=$(conda list malt --json | grep version | sed -e \"s/\\\"//g\" | awk '{print $2}')\ncd $env/opt/malt-$version\nsed -i -e \"s/-Xmx64G/-Xmx3G/\" malt-build.vmoptions\nsed -i -e \"s/-Xmx64G/-Xmx3G/\" malt-run.vmoptions\ncd -\nconda deactivate\n\ntouch .initdb\n\n## Run a quick test\nsnakemake --use-conda --show-failed-logs --conda-cleanup-pkgs cache -s ../workflow/Snakefile $@ --conda-frontend conda\n\nsnakemake -s ../workflow/Snakefile --report --report-stylesheet ../workflow/report/custom.css --conda-frontend conda\n\n## Now we move back into the main repository where we can symlink all the database files back to try running our 'own' test\n\ncd ../\ncd resources/\nln -s ../.test/resources/* .\ncd ../config\nmv config.yaml config.yaml.bkp\nmv samples.tsv samplest.tsv.bkp\ncd ../\nln -s .test/data/ .\n\n## Again get hte taxonomy tax dump for Krona, but this time for a real run\nenv=$(grep krona .snakemake/conda/*yaml | awk '{print $1}' | sed -e \"s/.yaml://g\" | head -1)\nconda activate $env\ncd $env/opt/krona\n./updateTaxonomy.sh taxonomy\ncd -\nconda deactivate\nOK now aMeta is all set up, we can now simulate running a ‘real’ pipeline job!\n\n\n17.4.2 aMeta configuration\nFirst, we will need to configure the workflow. First, we need to create a tab-delimited samples.tsv file inside aMeta/config/ and provide the names of the input fastq-files. In a text editor (e.g. nano), write the following names paths in TSV format.\n#| eval: false\nsample  fastq\nfoo data/bar.fq.gz\nbar data/foo.fq.gz\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nMake sure when copy pasting into your test editor, tabs are not replaced with spaces, otherwise the file might not be read!\n\n\nThen we need to write a config file. This tells aMeta where to find things such as database files and other settings.\nThese paths and settings go inside a config.yaml file inside aMeta/config/. A minimal example config.yaml files can look like this.\n#| eval: false\nsamplesheet: \"config/samples.tsv\"\n\nkrakenuniq_db: resources/KrakenUniq_DB\n\nbowtie2_db: resources/ref.fa\nbowtie2_seqid2taxid_db: resources/seqid2taxid.pathogen.map\npathogenomesFound: resources/pathogenomesFound.tab\n\nmalt_nt_fasta: resources/ref.fa\nmalt_seqid2taxid_db: resources/KrakenUniq_DB/seqid2taxid.map\nmalt_accession2taxid: resources/accession2taxid.map\n\nncbi_db: resources/ncbi\n\nn_unique_kmers: 1000\nn_tax_reads: 200\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAs this is only a dummy run (due to the large-ish computational resources required for KrakenUniq), we re-use some of the resource files here. While this will produce nonsense output, it is used here to demonstrate how you would execute the pipeline.\n\n\n\n\n17.4.3 Prepare and run aMeta\nMake sure you’re still in the aMeta conda environment, and in the main aMeta directory with\n#| eval: false\ncd /&lt;path/&lt;to&gt;/ancient-metagenomic-pipelines/ameta/aMeta/\nAnd, finally, we are ready to run aMeta!\n#| eval: false\n## change conda-frontend to mamba if you set this up earlier!\nsnakemake --snakefile workflow/Snakefile --use-conda -j 10 --conda-frontend conda\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can modify -j to represent the number of available CPUs you have on your machine.\nIf you are using conda is the frontend this could be quite slow!\n\n\nFirstly you’ll have displayed on the console a bunch of messages about JSON schemas, building DAG of jobs and downloading installing of conda environments. You will know the pipeline has started when you get green messages saying things like ‘Checkpoint’ and ‘Finished job XX’.\nYou’ll know the job is completed once you get the following messages\nFinished job 0.\n31 of 31 steps (100%) done\nComplete log: .snakemake/log/2023-10-05T155051.524987.snakemake.log\n\n\n17.4.4 aMeta output\nAll output files of the workflow are located in aMeta/results directory. To get a quick overview of ancient microbes present in your samples you should check a heatmap in results/overview_heatmap_scores.pdf.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.5: Example microbiome profiling summary heatmap from aMeta. The columns represent different samples, and the rows of different species. The cells of the heatmap are coloured from blue, to yellow, to red, representing aMeta authentication scores from 0 to 10, with the higher the number the more confident of the hit being both the correct taxonomic assignment and that it is ancient. Numbers in the coloured cells also provide the direct score number.\n\n\n\nThe heatmap demonstrates microbial species (in rows) authenticated for each sample (in columns) (Figure 17.5). The colors and the numbers in the heatmap represent authentications scores, i.e. numeric quantification of seven quality metrics that provide information about microbial presence and ancient status. The authentication scores can vary from 0 to 10, the higher is the score the more likely that a microbe is present in a sample and is ancient.\nTypically, scores from 8 to 10 (red color in the heatmap) provide good confidence of ancient microbial presence in a sample. Scores from 5 to 7 (yellow and orange colors in the heatmap) can imply that either: a) a microbe is present but not ancient, i.e. modern contaminant, or b) a microbe is ancient (the reads are damaged) but was perhaps aligned to a wrong reference, i.e. it is not the microbe you think about. The former is a more common case scenario. The latter often happens when an ancient microbe is correctly detected on a genus level but we are not confident about the exact species, and might be aligning the damaged reads to a non-optimal reference which leads to a lot of mismatches or poor evennes of coverage. Scores from 0 to 4 (blue color in the heatmap) typically mean that we have very little statistical evidence (very few reads) to claim presence of a microbe in a sample.\nTo visually examine the seven quality metrics\n\ndeamination profile,\nevenness of coverage,\nedit distance (amount of mismatches) for all reads,\nedit distance (amount of mismatches) for damaged reads,\nread length distribution,\nPMD scores distribution,\nnumber of assigned reads (depth of coverage),\n\nCorresponding to the numbers and colors of the heatmap, one can find them in results/AUTHENTICATION/sampleID/taxID/authentic_&lt;Sample&gt;_&lt;sampleID&gt;.trimmed.rma6_&lt;TaxID&gt;_&lt;taxID&gt;.pdf for each sample sampleID and each authenticated microbe taxID. An example of such quality metrics is shown below in Figure 17.6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.6: Example of sample/hit specific PDF output from aMeta, 9 panels represent different figures that are useful for evaluating the authenticitiy of an ancient metagenomic hit. From Left to Right, Top from bottom, the panels consist of: 1. Edit distance (all reads) bar plot, 2. Edit distance (ancient reads) bar plot, 3. Breadth of coverage line plot, 4. Deamination line plot, 5. Read length distribution bar plot, 6. PMD score histogram, 7. Percent identity bar plot, 8. table of similarity to hits from from closest hit to least closest, and 10. a general statistics table including the name of the taxonomic node, number of reads, duplicates, and mean read length etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n17.4.5 Clean up\nBefore continuing onto the next section of this chapter, you will need to deactivate from the conda environment\n#| eval: false\nconda deactivate",

    "section": "17.5 What is nf-core/mag?",
    "text": "17.5 What is nf-core/mag?\nnf-core/mag (Krakau et al. 2022) is another Nextflow best-practise pipeline for the de novo assembly, binning, and annotation of metagenomes (Figure 17.7). While it was originally designed for modern metagenomes (with a focus on optional support co-assembly with Nanopore long reads), it has since been updated to include specific functionality and parameters for ancient metagenomes too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.7: Overview diagram of the main steps and tools of the nf-core/mag pipeline. Taking reads in FASTQ format or a samplesheet as input, reads can go through adapter and/or quality trimming for specific tools for both short and long reads. These reads can optionally go into taxonomic classification and visualisation, at the same time as the prepared reads go into sample-or group wise assemply, evaluation, as well as the ancient DNA valdiation subworkflow. Resulting contigs can be functionally annotated at the same time as optionally going through binning and binning refinement and evaluation (with statistics generation). Bins and refined bins can be taxonomically classified and annotated, with all final reports going into MultiQC.\n\n\n\n\nnf-core/mag covers the same major steps as you will have run if you followed the chapter on De Novo assembly. Firstly, as with nf-core/eager, nf-core/mag do some initial sequencing QC and cleanup with fastp or AdapterRemoval, running FastQC before and after this step to make sure that adapters and overly short reads have been removed. It can then optionally do basic taxonomic classification of raw reads with Kraken2 or Centrifuge. The processed reads then ungo assembly with MEGAHIT, SPAdes, or SPAdeshybrid (the latter being for combining short and long reads), with contig annotation with Prodigal to get gene prediction and assembly statistics with QUAST. A unique feature of nf-core/mag over other de novo assembly pipelines is an aDNA validation and correction step: contigs under go ‘reference free’ damage profiling using pyDamage, and then remaining damage bases that are mistakenly incorporated by assemblies are corrected using freebayes and BCFTools. Contigs then optionally grouped into genomic ‘bins’ with a range of metagenomic binners (MetaBAT2, MaxBin2, and CONCOCT), as well as also optional binning refinement with DAS Tool. Bins are then re-annotated with Prokka, taxonomically classified with either CAT or GTDB-Tk Evaluation of the resulting bins is carried out with BUSCO, CheckM, GUNC and/or QUAST to assess the bin completeness. And, as with all nf-core pipelines, all the results are wrapped up into a MultiQC report. Detailed documnetation can be see on the nf-core/mag parameters and output pages.\n\n17.5.1 Running nf-core/mag\nFirst re-activate the chapter’s conda environment.\n#| eval: false\nconda activate ancient-metagenomic-pipelines\nIn this tutorial, we will use the same data and aim to replicate the steps taken in the De Novo assembly chapter. It is important to note that generally, de novo assembly, is very computational intensive. In many cases it will not be able to run a de novo assembly on a standard laptop, therefore some of the parameters used here have been tweaked to get the pipeline runable on powerful laptop level machines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf guided: reference download and preparation\n\n\n\n\n\nThis tutorial will re-use the data from the de novo assembly chapter. If you have not-run that practical, or deleted the data, pleas follow the instructions at the top of the de novo assembly page to download the denovo-assembly.tar.gz file and unpack it into the denovo-assembly directory.\nMake sure once you’ve finished, change back into this chapter’s directory with\n#| eval: false\ncd /&lt;path&gt;/&lt;to&gt;/ancient-metagenomic-pipelines\n\n\n\nThe manual steps of the previous chapter included:\n\nRead clean up with fastp,\nAssembly with MEGAHIT,\nAncient DNA assessment and correction with freebayes and pyDamage\nBinning using MetaBAT2 and MaxBin2 (originally using the MetaWRAP pipeline),\nBin assessment with CheckM\nContig taxonomic classification with MMSeqs2 via the GTDB database\nGenome annotation with prokka\n\nSo, what command would we use to recreate these?\n#| eval: false\n## 🛑 Don't run this yet! 🛑\nnextflow run nf-core/mag -r 2.3.2 \\\n-profile test,docker \\\n--input '../../denovo-assembly/seqdata_files/*{R1,R2}.fastq.gz' --outdir ./results \\\n--ancient_dna  --binning_map_mode own \\\n--binqc_tool checkm --checkm_db data/checkm_data_2015_01_16/ \\\n--centrifuge_db false --kraken2_db false --skip_krona --skip_spades --skip_spadeshybrid --skip_maxbin2 --skip_concoct --skip_prodigal --gtdb false  --busco_reference false \nIn fact, nf-core/mag will do most of the steps for you! In this case, we mostly just need to deactivate most of the additional steps (the last line). Otherwise, as with eager we have done the following:\n\nTell nextflow to run the nf-core/mag pipeline with version 2.3.2\nSpecify which computing and software environment to use with -profile\n\nIn this case we are running locally so we don’t specify a computing environment (such as a configuration for an institutional HPC)\nWe use docker as our container engine, which downloads all the software and specific versions needed for nf-core/mag in immutable ‘containers’, to ensure nothing get broken and is as nf-core/mag expects\n\nProvide the various paths to the input files - the raw FASTQ files and the output directory\nSpecify we want to run the aDNA mode with mapping of reads back to the original contigs rather than for co-assembly\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBinning mapping mode with ancient DNA\n\n\n\n\n\nThe aDNA mode of nf-core/mag only supports mapping reads back to the original contigs. The other mapping modes are when doing co-assembly, where you assume there are similar organisms across all your metagenomes, and wish to map reads from all samples in a group to a single sample’s contig (for example). Doing this on aDNA reads would risk making false positive damage patterns, as the damaged reads may derive from reads from a different sample with damage, that are otherwise not present in the sample used for generating the given contig.\n\n\n\nSpecify we want to generate completeness statistics with CheckM (rather than BUSCO), with the associated pre-downloaded database\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnf-core pipelines and reference files\n\n\n\n\n\nMost nf-core pipelines will actually download reference databases, build reference indices for alignment, and in some cases reference genomes for you if you do not specify them as pipeline input. These download and reference building steps are often very time consuming, so it’s recommended that once you’ve let the database download it once, you should move the files somewhere safe and you can re-use in subsequent pipeline runs.\n\n\n\nSkip a few steps that are either ‘nice to have’ (e.g. read taxonomic classification), or require large computational resources (e.g. metaSPAdes, CONCOCT or BUSCO)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation on skipped tests\n\n\n\n\n\nThe steps we are skipping are: host/arefact removal (Bowtie2 removal of phiX), taxonomic classification of reads (centrifuge, kraken2, krona), the additional assemblers (metaSPAdes and SPAdeshybrid, as these require very large computational resources), additional binners (MaxBin2 and CONCOCT, while they are used in the de novo assembly chapter, they take a long time to run), ship raw contig annotation (with Prodigal, as we do this at the bin level), and contig taxonomic classification (with GTDB and BUSCO as they require very large databases).\n\n\n\n\nWith this we are almost ready for running the pipeline!\n\n\n17.5.2 Configuring Nextflow pipelines\nBefore we execute the command however, we need to again consider about the resource requirements. As described above, particularly de novo assembly (but also many other bioinformatic analyses) require a lot of computational resources, depending on the type of data and analyses you wish to run.\nFor most pipelines you must tweak the resource requirements to ensure a) they will fit on your cluster, and b) will run optimally so you don’t under- or over- use your computational resources, where latter will either make yourself (takes too long), or your cluser/server system administrators (blocks other users) unhappy!\nWhile nf-core pipelines all have ‘reasonable default’ settings for memory, CPU, and time limits, they will not work in all contexts. Here we will give a brief example of how to tweak the parameters of the pipeline steps so that they can run on our compute node or laptop.\nFor Nextflow, we must make a special ‘config’ that defines the names of each step of the pipeline you wish to tweak and the corresponding resources.\nFor this our nf-core/mag run you will need to open your text editor an empty file called custom.config, and copy and paste the contents of the next code block.\nprocess {\n\n  withName: FASTP { \n    cpus = 8\n  }\n\n  withName: BOWTIE2_PHIX_REMOVAL_ALIGN { \n    cpus = 8\n  }\n\n  withName: BOWTIE2_ASSEMBLY_ALIGN {    \n    cpus = 8\n  }\n\n  withName: PYDAMAGE_ANALYZE {      \n    cpus = 8\n  }\n\n  withName: PROKKA {\n    cpus = 4\n  }\n\n  withName: MEGAHIT {\n    cpus = 8\n  }\n\n  withName: CHECKM_LINEAGEWF{\n    memory = 24.GB\n    cpus   = 8\n    ext.args = \"--reduced_tree\"\n  }\n\n}\nHere we set the number of CPUs for most tools to a maximum of 8, and then we limit the amount of memory for CheckM to 24 GB (down from the default of 36 GB - which exceeds most laptop memory). We also give a specifc CheckM flag command to use a smaller database.\nWe can save this custom.config file, and supply this to the Nextflow command with the nextflow parameter (-c). The good thing about the config file, is you can re-use across runs on the same machine! So set once, and never think about it again.\nAnd with that, you can run your nf-core/mag pipeline!\nAs recommended in the nf-core/eager section above, start a screen session.\n#| eval: false\nscreen -R mag\nThen execute the command.\n#| eval: false\nnextflow run nf-core/mag -r 2.3.2 \\\n-profile test,docker \\\n--input '../../denovo-assembly/seqdata_files/*{R1,R2}.fastq.gz' --outdir ./results \\\n--ancient_dna  --binning_map_mode own \\\n--binqc_tool checkm --checkm_db data/checkm_data_2015_01_16/ \\\n--centrifuge_db false --kraken2_db false --skip_krona --skip_spades --skip_spadeshybrid --skip_maxbin2 --skip_concoct --skip_prodigal --gtdb false  --busco_reference false \\\n-c custom.config\nAgain as with nf-coire/eager when the run starts, you see a long list of process lines with progress bars slowly appearing over time. If in a screen session, you can press ctrl + a and then [ to access a ‘navigation’ (called ‘copy’) mode, then use your arrow keys on your keyboard to scroll up and down. To quit this mode just press q.\nThe pipeline run above should take around 20 minutes or so to complete.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nConfiguration files don’t need be personal nor custom!\nYou can also generate a HPC / server specific profile which can be used on all nf-core pipelines (and even your own!).\nSee nf-co.re/configs for all existing institutional configs\n\n\n\n\n17.5.3 nf-core/mag output\nAs with nf-core/eager, you will have a results directory containing many folders representing different stages of the pipeline, and a MultiQC report.\n\n17.5.3.1 Results Files\nRelevant directories for evaluting your assemblies are as follows:\n\nQC_shortreads/\n\nContains various folders from the sequencing QC and raw read processing (e.g., FastQC, fastp/AdapterRemoval, host-removal results etc)\n\nTaxonomy/\n\nIf you have not already performed taxonomic classification of your reads, the output of the Kraken2 or Centrifuge integrated steps of nf-core/mag will be deposited here, including an optional Krona piechart\nIf activated, the contig-level taxonomic assignments will be deposited here (e.g. from CAT or GTDB)\n\nAssembly/\n\nThis directory will contain one directory per chosen assembler which will contain per-sample output files for each assembly.\nWithin each of the assembler sub directories, a QC folder will contain the QUAST output\n\nAncient_DNA\n\nThis folder will contain the output of pyDamge contig authentication to allow you to select or filter for just putatively ancient contigs\n\nvariant_calling\n\nThis directory will contain the ‘damage-corrected’ contigs that will be used in downstream steps of the pipeline, if the aDNA mode is turned on\n\nGenomeBinning/\n\nThis directory will contain all the output from each of any of the selected contig binning tools. As well as the binned FASTAs, you also have read-depth statistics from when input reads are re-mapped back to the contigs\nThe directory will also contain the output from the DASTool binning refinement if turned on\nIn the QC sub-directory of this folder, you will find the QUAST results on the genome bins (rather than raw contigs as above), as well as BUSCO/CheckM/GUNC MAG completeness estimates\n\nProdigal / Prokka\n\nThese directories will contain the genome annotation output of the raw contigs (Prodigal) or from bins (Prokka)\n\n\n\n\n17.5.3.2 Report Table\nAs of v2.3.* the MultiQC report is unfortunately broken, however this has been fixed for 2.4, and many of the questions asked in the preprocessing section of the nf-core/eager results interpretation will also apply here.\nOther than the QUAST results in the Assembly/*/QC/ or GenomeBinning/*/QC/ directories, the main table used for evaluating the output files is the bin_summary.tsv table in the GenomeBinning/ directory.\nIn this file you woud typically want to assess the following columns:\n\n% Complete * columns - with the higher the number of expected domain-specific genes, normally representing a better quality of the resulting bin.\n# contigs (&gt;=* bp) columns - which represnts the number of contigs at different lengths, the fewer the shorter reads and the greater the longer reads you have again suggests a better assembly.\nThis can also be evaluated by the N50 or L75 columns (as described in the De novo assembly chapter).\nfastani and closest_placement_taxonomy - these can tell you if your particular bin has a genome very similar to existing species in taxonomic databases\nwarnings - for specific comments on each assignment",

    "section": "21.3 Formatting",
    "text": "21.3 Formatting\nGenerally, Quarto follows standard Markdown with some extra ‘syntax’ sugar. A Markdown cheatsheet can be found here.\n\n21.3.1 General Markdown\n\nOne sentence per line.\ni.e., this is bad:\nFor example this is the first sentence. Here is the second sentence. This makes reviewing on GitHub harder.\nThis is good:\nFor example this is the first sentence.\nHere is the second sentence.\nThis makes reviewing on GitHub easier.\nNew paragraphs should be separated by a blank line.\nThis would be a first sentence.\nThen a second sentence.\n\nThen a new paragraph.\nAnd so on.\n\nTo continue\n\nItalic formatting should be used with a single underscore _ and should be used for emphasis\nIf required, Bold formatting should be used with double asterisks **. This should not be used for emphasis\n\nBold formatting should be used to indicate words for inclusion in a glossary, or to indicate the first word of bullet lists\n\nURLs should be both hyperlinked around a relevant bit of text\n\nFor example, for visit the SPAAM Website this should be rendered visit the[SPAAM Website](https://www.spaam-community.org/)\nThis is to make sure URLs in printed copies of the textbook are still visible\n\nBullet point lists must start with a capital letter and not end with a full stop\n\n\n\n21.3.2 Notes and tips\nFor side nodes, tips, warnings, etc. you should Quarto callout blocks.\nFor example.\n::: {.callout-warning}\nWe reserve some callout formatting for specific objects!\n:::\nGets rendered like this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWe reserve some callout formatting for specific objects!\n\n\nSee the Chapter Content for the reserved formatting. Note: I rendered that within-page link with [Chapter Content](#chapter-content) syntax, where #chapter-content is the name of the header in all lowercase and all punctiation replaced with -.\n\n\n21.3.3 Code\nSingle backticks for inline code should only be used for single words such as tool names, e.g. samtools, file extensions such as .txt, or single paths &lt;path&gt;/&lt;to&gt;/&lt;here&gt;.\nAny form of commands or code should be formatted as code in a syntax-named triple backtick block. Execution should be turned off by default (with eval: false in a code block header block), unless has a very low computational overhead and can be rendered on the fly. Language should be specified.\nFor example, this is a bash code block that has a whole command.\n    ```bash\n    #| eval: false\n    echo \"SPAAM rules!\"\n    ```\nAnd gets rendered as like this.\necho \"SPAAM rules!\"\nIf you wish to display large output from a code block that does get executed, you should turn off the command execution printing in the code block itself, and use a collapsible callout block with a ‘Expand to see output’ title immediately after the code block itself that contains. The content of the output should also be in a triple backtick block, with the the default syntax specified.\necho \"SPAAM rules!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand see output\n\n\n\n\n\n#| eval: false\nSPAAM rules!\n\n\n\nThis was generated with\n    ```bash\n#| eval: false\n    echo \"SPAAM rules!\"\n    ```\n    ::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n    ## Expand see output\n\n    ```{.default, eval = false}\n    SPAAM rules!\n    ```\n    :::\nAdditional guidance is as follows:\n\nSentences prior a code block must end in a full stop and not a colon\nAll code blocks must have a language specified\nDo not include leading $ or other prompt indicators at the beginning of code blocks\n\nThis makes copy pasting harder\n\nAny paths to should ideally be relative to the ‘working’ directory of that chapter\n\nThis ensures portability of code between different systems and readers\n\nIf paths require placeholders they should be in &lt;angle brackets&gt;\nAny code that should not actually be run by the user should be wrapped in a ‘warning’ callout block\nOptional ‘self-guided’ sections (i.e. sections that require user setup and would normally be already prepared for users by summer school organisers prior the summer school), should have be in a collapsed self-guided .callout-note with a title prefixed with Self guided:\n\n\n\n21.3.4 Figures\nFigures should be included in the assets/images/chapters/&lt;your-chapter&gt;/ directory.\nThey can be inserted into a chapter either with typical markdown syntax or with the HTML (e.g. for centering purposes).\nRegardless of the method used, the image should be given a caption, and a quarto label with the fig prefix ({#fig-&lt;chapternamewithnopunctiation&gt;-&lt;imageidwithnopunctuation&gt;}) for referencing the figure in the text.\nFor example, the following.\n![A mock up of a possible full-book jacket for this textbook. The left hand side includes a blurb and a list of contributors, and hte SPAAM logo. The right hand side includes the title of the book, a sankey diagram, and an 'edited by' section.](assets/images/jacket.png){#fig-chapterwritingguidelines-jacket}\nWould be rendered as as follows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21.1: A mock up of a possible full-book jacket for this textbook. The left hand side includes a blurb and a list of contributors, and hte SPAAM logo. The right hand side includes the title of the book, a sankey diagram, and an ‘edited by’ section.\n\n\n\nIt is important for the caption to be as descriptive as possible to account for accessibility reasons.\nAll figures should be referenced in the text using the quarto label, and without a leading ‘Figure’ (this is rendered for you) e.g,.\n \"@fig-chapterwritingguidelines-jacket shows an example figure\"\nGets rendered as:\n“Figure Figure 21.1 shows an example figure”.\n\n\n21.3.5 Tables\nMuch like figures, all markdown tables must have a caption and referenced in text. To copy the quarto documentation example.\n| Default | Left | Right | Center |\n|---------|:-----|------:|:------:|\n| 12      | 12   |    12 |   12   |\n| 123     | 123  |   123 |  123   |\n| 1       | 1    |     1 |   1    |\n\n: Demonstration of pipe table syntax {#tbl-chapterwritingguidelines-exampletable1}\nGets rendered as in Table 21.1.\n\n\n\nTable 21.1: Demonstration of pipe table syntax\n\n\n\n\n\nDefault\nLeft\nRight\nCenter\n\n\n\n\n12\n12\n12\n12\n\n\n123\n123\n123\n123\n\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis also applies to code-block generated tables e.g. as in Table 21.2. For example the next code block (if wrapped in the triple-backticks with r syntax, not shown here).\n    \n    #| label: tbl-chapterwritingguidelines-examplecodetable2\n    #| echo: false\n    #| results: 'asis'\n    #| tbl-cap: \"Your caption goes here.\"\n    #| tbl-cap-location: top\n    library(tidyverse)\n    library(pander)\n    tibble(a = 1, b = 2) %&gt;%\n        pandoc.table(., split.tables = Inf)\n    \nGets rendered as follows.\n\n\n\nTable 21.2: Your caption goes here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na\nb\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your table is too wide, you may load the table and use some R code render the table in a more readable format.\nTo do so, place the CSV file in the assets/images/chapters/&lt;your-chapter&gt;/ directory. Then use the following template to render the table in your chapter. .qmd file.\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\n# Load the data from CSV\ndata &lt;- read_csv(\"assets/images/chapters/&lt;chapter-name&gt;/&lt;filename&gt;.csv\")\n\n# Create the table with gt\ndata %&gt;%\n    gt() %&gt;%\n    tab_options(\n        table.width = pct(100),\n        table.layout = \"fixed\",\n        container.overflow.x = \"scroll\"\n    )",
