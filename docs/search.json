    "text": "Introduction\nAncient metagenomics applies cutting-edge metagenomic methods to the degraded DNA content of archaeological and palaeontological specimens. The rapidly growing field is currently uncovering a wealth of novel information for both human and natural history, from identifying the causes of devastating pandemics such as the Black Death, to revealing how past ecosystems changed in response to long-term climatic and anthropogenic change, to reconstructing the microbiomes of extinct human relatives. However, as the field grows, the techniques, methods, and workflows used to analyse such data are rapidly changing and improving.\nIn this book we will go through the main steps of ancient metagenomic bioinformatic workflows, familiarising students with the command line, demonstrating how to process next-generation-sequencing (NGS) data, and showing how to perform de novo metagenomic assembly. Focusing on host-associated ancient metagenomics, the book consists of a combination of theory and hands-on exercises, allowing readers to become familiar with the types of questions and data researchers work with.\nBy the end of the textbook, readers will have an understanding of how to effectively carry out the major bioinformatic components of an ancient metagenomic project in an open and transparent manner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you export the PDF or ePub versions of this book, some sections maybe excluded (such as videos, and embedded slide decks). Always refer to this website in doubt.\n\n\nAll material was originally developed for the SPAAM Summer School: Introduction to Ancient Metagenomics"

    "text": "Lectures\n\nIntroduction to NGS Sequencing\nIn this chapter, we will introduce how we are able to convert DNA molecules to human readable sequences of A, C, T, and Gs, which we can subsequently can computationally analyse.\nThe field of Ancient DNA was revolutionised by the development of ‘Next Generation Sequencing’ (NGS), which relies on sequencing of millions of short fragments of DNA in parallel. The global leading DNA sequencing company is Illumina, and the technology used by Illumina is also most popular by palaeogeneticists. Therefore we will go through the various technologies behind Illumina next-generation sequencing machines.\nWe will also look at some important differences in the way different models of Illumina sequences work, and how this can influence ancient DNA research. Finally we will cover the structure of ‘FASTQ’ files, the most popular file format for representing the DNA sequence output of NGS sequencing machines.\n\n\nIntroduction to Ancient DNA\nThis chapter introduces you to ancient DNA and the enormous technological changes that have taken place since the field’s origins in 1984. Starting with the quagga and proceeding to microbes, we discuss where ancient microbial DNA can be found in the archaeological record and examine how ancient DNA is defined by its condition, not by a fixed age.\nWe next cover genome basics and take an in-depth look at the way DNA degrades over time. We detail the fundamentals of DNA damage, including the specific chemical processes that lead to DNA fragmentation and C-&gt;T miscoding lesions. We then demystify the DNA damage “smiley plot” and explain the how the plot’s symmetry or asymmetry is related to the specific enzymes used to repair DNA during library construction. We discuss how DNA damage is and is not clock-like, how to interpret and troubleshoot DNA damage plots, and how DNA damage patters can be used to authenticate ancient samples, specific taxa, and even sequences. We cover laboratory strategies for removing or reducing damage for greater accuracy for genotype calling, and we discuss the pros and cons of single-stranded library protocols. We then take a closer look at proofreading and non-proofreading polymerases and note key steps in NGS library preparation during which enzyme selection is critical in ancient DNA studies.\nFinally, we examine the big picture of why DNA damage matters in ancient microbial studies, and its effects on taxonomic identification of sequences, accurate genome mapping, and metagenomic assembly.\n\n\nIntroduction to Metagenomics\nThis chapter introduces you to the basics of metagenomics, with an emphasis on tools and approaches that are used to study ancient metagenomes. We begin by covering the basic terminology used in metagenomics and microbiome research and discuss how the field has changed over time. We examine the species concept for microbes and challenges that arise in classifying microbial species with respect to taxonomy and phylogeny. We then proceed to taxonomic profiling and discuss the pros and cons of different taxonomic profilers.\nAfterwards, we explain how to estimate preservation in ancient metagenomic samples and how to clean up your datasets and remove contaminants. Finally, we discuss strategies for exploring and comparing the ecological diversity in your samples, including different strategies for data normalization, distance calculation, and ordination.\n\n\nIntroduction to Microbial Genomics\nThe field of microbial genomics aims at the reconstruction and comparative analyses of genomes for gaining insights into the genetic foundation and evolution of various functional aspects such as virulence mechanisms in pathogens.\nIncluding data from ancient samples into this comparative assessment allows for studying these evolutionary changes through time. This, for example, provides insights into the emergence of human pathogens and their development in conjunction with human cultural transitions.\nIn this chapter we will look examples for how to utilise data from ancient genomes in comparative studies of human pathogens and today’s practical sessions will highlight methodologies for the reconstruction of microbial genomes.\n\n\nIntroduction to Evolutionary Biology\nPathogen genome data are an invaluable source of information about the evolution and spread of these organisms. This chapter will focus on molecular phylogenetic methods and the insight that they can reveal from improving our understanding of ancient evolution to the epidemiological dynamics of current outbreaks.\nThe first section will introduce phylognenetic trees and a set of core terms and concepts for their interpretation. Next, it will focus on some of the most popular approaches to inferring phylogenetic trees; those based on genetic distance, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference. These methods carry important considerations regarding the process that generated the data, computational capability, and data quality, all of which will be discussed here. Finally, we will direct our attention to examples of analyses of ancient and modern pathogens (e.g. Yersinia pestis, Hepatitis B virus, SARS-CoV-2) and critically assess appropriate choice of models and methods."

By learning bash, users can work more efficiently and reproducibly on these remote servers.\nIn this chapter we will introduce the basic concepts of bash and the command line. Students will learn how to move around the filesystem and interact with files, how to chain multiple commands together using “pipes”, and how to use loops and regular expressions to simplify the running of repetitive tasks.\nFinally, readers will learn how to create a bash script of their own, that can run a set of commands in sequence. This session requires no prior knowledge of bash or the command line and is meant to serve as an entry-level introduction to basic programming concepts that can be applicable in other programming languages too."

reduce to two columns\ndplyr::select(samples, -project_name, -sample_age) # remove two columns\ndplyr::filter allows for conditional filtering of rows\ndplyr::filter(samples, publication_year == 2014)  #

sample quantiles for the given probs\nmany of these functions can ignore missing values with an option na.rm = TRUE\n\n\n\n7.5.4 Group-wise summaries with group_by and summarise\n\nThese summary statistics are particular useful when applied to conditional subsets of a dataset\ndplyr allows such summary operations with a combination of group_by and summarise\nsamples %&gt;%\ndplyr::group_by(material) %&gt;%  # group the tibble by the material column\ndplyr::summarise(\n    min_age = min(sample_age),   # a new column: min age for each group\n    median_age = median(sample_age), # a new column: median age for each group\n    max_age = max(sample_age)    #

While a few years ago, it was often necessary to go back to R for performing routine data manipulation and analysis tasks, nowadays Python has a vast ecosystem of libraries for doing just that.\nToday, we will do a quick introduction of the most popular libraries for data analysis:\n\npandas, for reading and manipulation tabular data\nplotnine, the Python clone of ggplot2"

The string could be a URL. Valid\n        URL schemes include http, ftp, s3, gs, and file. For file URLs, a host is\n        expected. A local file could be: file://localhost/path/to/table.csv.\n\n        If you want to pass in a path object, pandas accepts any ``os.PathLike``.\n\n        By file-like object, we refer to objects with a ``read()`` method, such as\n        a file handle (e.g. via builtin ``open`` function) or ``StringIO``.\n    sep : str, default ','\n        Delimiter to use. If sep is None, the C engine cannot automatically detect\n        the separator, but the Python parsing engine can, meaning the latter will\n        be used and automatically detect the separator by Python's builtin sniffer\n        tool, ``csv.Sniffer``. In addition, separators longer than 1 character and\n        different from ``'\\s+'`` will be interpreted as regular expressions and\n        will also force the use of the Python parsing engine. Note that regex\n        delimiters are prone to ignoring quoted data. Regex example: ``'\\r\\t'``.\n    delimiter : str, default ``None``\n        Alias for sep.\n    header : int, list of int, None, default 'infer'\n        Row number(s) to use as the column names, and the start of the\n        data.  Default behavior is to infer the column names: if no names\n        are passed the behavior is identical to ``header=0`` and column\n        names are inferred from the first line of the file, if column\n        names are passed explicitly then the behavior is identical to\n        ``header=None``. Explicitly pass ``header=0`` to be able to\n        replace existing names. The header can be a list of integers that\n        specify row locations for a multi-index on the columns\n        e.g. [0,1,3]. Intervening rows that are not specified will be\n        skipped (e.g. 2 in this example is skipped). Note that this\n        parameter ignores commented lines and empty lines if\n        ``skip_blank_lines=True``, so ``header=0`` denotes the first line of\n        data rather than the first line of the file.\n    names : array-like, optional\n        List of column names to use. If the file contains a header row,\n        then you should explicitly pass ``header=0`` to override the column names.\n        Duplicates in this list are not allowed.\n    index_col : int, str, sequence of int / str, or False, optional, default ``None``\n      Column(s) to use as the row labels of the ``DataFrame``, either given as\n      string name or column index. If a sequence of int / str is given, a\n      MultiIndex is used.\n\n      Note: ``index_col=False`` can be used to force pandas to *not* use the first\n      column as the index, e.g. when you have a malformed file with delimiters at\n      the end of each line.\n    usecols : list-like or callable, optional\n        Return a subset of the columns. If list-like, all elements must either\n        be positional (i.e. integer indices into the document columns) or strings\n        that correspond to column names provided either by the user in `names` or\n        inferred from the document header row(s). If ``names`` are given, the document\n        header row(s) are not taken into account. For example, a valid list-like\n        `usecols` parameter would be ``[0, 1, 2]`` or ``['foo', 'bar', 'baz']``.\n        Element order is ignored, so ``usecols=[0, 1]`` is the same as ``[1, 0]``.\n        To instantiate a DataFrame from ``data`` with element order preserved use\n        ``pd.read_csv(data, usecols=['foo', 'bar'])[['foo', 'bar']]`` for columns\n        in ``['foo', 'bar']`` order or\n        ``pd.read_csv(data, usecols=['foo', 'bar'])[['bar', 'foo']]``\n        for ``['bar', 'foo']`` order.\n\n        If callable, the callable function will be evaluated against the column\n        names, returning names where the callable function evaluates to True. An\n        example of a valid callable argument would be ``lambda x: x.upper() in\n        ['AAA', 'BBB', 'DDD']``. Using this parameter results in much faster\n        parsing time and lower memory usage.\n    squeeze : bool, default False\n        If the parsed data only contains one column then return a Series.\n\n        .. deprecated:: 1.4.0\n            Append ``.squeeze(\"columns\")`` to the call to ``read_csv`` to squeeze\n            the data.\n    prefix : str, optional\n        Prefix to add to column numbers when no header, e.g. 'X' for X0, X1, ...\n\n        .. deprecated:: 1.4.0\n           Use a list comprehension on the DataFrame's columns after calling ``read_csv``.\n    mangle_dupe_cols : bool, default True\n        Duplicate columns will be specified as 'X', 'X.1', ...'X.N', rather than\n        'X'...'X'. Passing in False will cause data to be overwritten if there\n        are duplicate names in the columns.\n    dtype : Type name or dict of column -&gt; type, optional\n        Data type for data or columns. E.g. {'a': np.float64, 'b': np.int32,\n        'c': 'Int64'}\n        Use `str` or `object` together with suitable `na_values` settings\n        to preserve and not interpret dtype.\n        If converters are specified, they will be applied INSTEAD\n        of dtype conversion.\n    engine : {'c', 'python', 'pyarrow'}, optional\n        Parser engine to use. The C and pyarrow engines are faster, while the python engine\n        is currently more feature-complete. Multithreading is currently only supported by\n        the pyarrow engine.\n\n        .. versionadded:: 1.4.0\n\n            The \"pyarrow\" engine was added as an *experimental* engine, and some features\n            are unsupported, or may not work correctly, with this engine.\n    converters : dict, optional\n        Dict of functions for converting values in certain columns. Keys can either\n        be integers or column labels.\n    true_values : list, optional\n        Values to consider as True.\n    false_values : list, optional\n        Values to consider as False.\n    skipinitialspace : bool, default False\n        Skip spaces after delimiter.\n    skiprows : list-like, int or callable, optional\n        Line numbers to skip (0-indexed) or number of lines to skip (int)\n        at the start of the file.\n\n        If callable, the callable function will be evaluated against the row\n        indices, returning True if the row should be skipped and False otherwise.\n        An example of a valid callable argument would be ``lambda x: x in [0, 2]``.\n    skipfooter : int, default 0\n        Number of lines at bottom of file to skip (Unsupported with engine='c').\n    nrows : int, optional\n        Number of rows of file to read. Useful for reading pieces of large files.\n    na_values : scalar, str, list-like, or dict, optional\n        Additional strings to recognize as NA/NaN. If dict passed, specific\n        per-column NA values.  By default the following values are interpreted as\n        NaN: '', '#N/A', '#N/A N/A', '#NA', '-1.#IND', '-1.#QNAN', '-NaN', '-nan',\n        '1.#IND', '1.#QNAN', '&lt;NA&gt;', 'N/A', 'NA', 'NULL', 'NaN', 'n/a',\n        'nan', 'null'.\n    keep_default_na : bool, default True\n        Whether or not to include the default NaN values when parsing the data.\n        Depending on whether `na_values` is passed in, the behavior is as follows:\n\n        * If `keep_default_na` is True, and `na_values` are specified, `na_values`\n          is appended to the default NaN values used for parsing.\n        * If `keep_default_na` is True, and `na_values` are not specified, only\n          the default NaN values are used for parsing.\n        * If `keep_default_na` is False, and `na_values` are specified, only\n          the NaN values specified `na_values` are used for parsing.\n        * If `keep_default_na` is False, and `na_values` are not specified, no\n          strings will be parsed as NaN.\n\n        Note that if `na_filter` is passed in as False, the `keep_default_na` and\n        `na_values` parameters will be ignored.\n    na_filter : bool, default True\n        Detect missing value markers (empty strings and the value of na_values). In\n        data without any NAs, passing na_filter=False can improve the performance\n        of reading a large file.\n    verbose : bool, default False\n        Indicate number of NA values placed in non-numeric columns.\n    skip_blank_lines : bool, default True\n        If True, skip over blank lines rather than interpreting as NaN values.\n    parse_dates : bool or list of int or names or list of lists or dict, default False\n        The behavior is as follows:\n\n        * boolean. If True -&gt; try parsing the index.\n        * list of int or names. e.g. If [1, 2, 3] -&gt; try parsing columns 1, 2, 3\n          each as a separate date column.\n        * list of lists. e.g.  If [[1, 3]] -&gt; combine columns 1 and 3 and parse as\n          a single date column.\n        * dict, e.g. {'foo' : [1, 3]} -&gt; parse columns 1, 3 as date and call\n          result 'foo'\n\n        If a column or index cannot be represented as an array of datetimes,\n        say because of an unparsable value or a mixture of timezones, the column\n        or index will be returned unaltered as an object data type. For\n        non-standard datetime parsing, use ``pd.to_datetime`` after\n        ``pd.read_csv``. To parse an index or column with a mixture of timezones,\n        specify ``date_parser`` to be a partially-applied\n        :func:`pandas.to_datetime` with ``utc=True``. See\n        :ref:`io.csv.mixed_timezones` for more.\n\n        Note: A fast-path exists for iso8601-formatted dates.\n    infer_datetime_format : bool, default False\n        If True and `parse_dates` is enabled, pandas will attempt to infer the\n        format of the datetime strings in the columns, and if it can be inferred,\n        switch to a faster method of parsing them. In some cases this can increase\n        the parsing speed by 5-10x.\n    keep_date_col : bool, default False\n        If True and `parse_dates` specifies combining multiple columns then\n        keep the original columns.\n    date_parser : function, optional\n        Function to use for converting a sequence of string columns to an array of\n        datetime instances. The default uses ``dateutil.parser.parser`` to do the\n        conversion. Pandas will try to call `date_parser` in three different ways,\n        advancing to the next if an exception occurs: 1) Pass one or more arrays\n        (as defined by `parse_dates`) as arguments; 2) concatenate (row-wise) the\n        string values from the columns defined by `parse_dates` into a single array\n        and pass that; and 3) call `date_parser` once for each row using one or\n        more strings (corresponding to the columns defined by `parse_dates`) as\n        arguments.\n    dayfirst : bool, default False\n        DD/MM format dates, international and European format.\n    cache_dates : bool, default True\n        If True, use a cache of unique, converted dates to apply the datetime\n        conversion. May produce significant speed-up when parsing duplicate\n        date strings, especially ones with timezone offsets.\n\n        .. versionadded:: 0.25.0\n    iterator : bool, default False\n        Return TextFileReader object for iteration or getting chunks with\n        ``get_chunk()``.\n\n        .. versionchanged:: 1.2\n\n           ``TextFileReader`` is a context manager.\n    chunksize : int, optional\n        Return TextFileReader object for iteration.\n        See the `IO Tools docs\n        &lt;https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/io.html#io-chunking&gt;`_\n        for more information on ``iterator`` and ``chunksize``.\n\n        .. versionchanged:: 1.2\n\n           ``TextFileReader`` is a context manager.\n    compression : str or dict, default 'infer'\n        For on-the-fly decompression of on-disk data. If 'infer' and '%s' is\n        path-like, then detect compression from the following extensions: '.gz',\n        '.bz2', '.zip', '.xz', or '.zst' (otherwise no compression). If using\n        'zip', the ZIP file must contain only one data file to be read in. Set to\n        ``None`` for no decompression. Can also be a dict with key ``'method'`` set\n        to one of {``'zip'``, ``'gzip'``, ``'bz2'``, ``'zstd'``} and other\n        key-value pairs are forwarded to ``zipfile.ZipFile``, ``gzip.GzipFile``,\n        ``bz2.BZ2File``, or ``zstandard.ZstdDecompressor``, respectively. As an\n        example, the following could be passed for Zstandard decompression using a\n        custom compression dictionary:\n        ``compression={'method': 'zstd', 'dict_data': my_compression_dict}``.\n\n        .. versionchanged:: 1.4.0 Zstandard support.\n\n    thousands : str, optional\n        Thousands separator.\n    decimal : str, default '.'\n        Character to recognize as decimal point (e.g. use ',' for European data).\n    lineterminator : str (length 1), optional\n        Character to break file into lines. Only valid with C parser.\n    quotechar : str (length 1), optional\n        The character used to denote the start and end of a quoted item. Quoted\n        items can include the delimiter and it will be ignored.\n    quoting : int or csv.QUOTE_* instance, default 0\n        Control field quoting behavior per ``csv.QUOTE_*`` constants. Use one of\n        QUOTE_MINIMAL (0), QUOTE_ALL (1), QUOTE_NONNUMERIC (2) or QUOTE_NONE (3).\n    doublequote : bool, default ``True``\n       When quotechar is specified and quoting is not ``QUOTE_NONE``, indicate\n       whether or not to interpret two consecutive quotechar elements INSIDE a\n       field as a single ``quotechar`` element.\n    escapechar : str (length 1), optional\n        One-character string used to escape other characters.\n    comment : str, optional\n        Indicates remainder of line should not be parsed. If found at the beginning\n        of a line, the line will be ignored altogether. This parameter must be a\n        single character. Like empty lines (as long as ``skip_blank_lines=True``),\n        fully commented lines are ignored by the parameter `header` but not by\n        `skiprows`. For example, if ``comment='#'``, parsing\n        ``#empty\\na,b,c\\n1,2,3`` with ``header=0`` will result in 'a,b,c' being\n        treated as the header.\n    encoding : str, optional\n        Encoding to use for UTF when reading/writing (ex. 'utf-8'). `List of Python\n        standard encodings\n        &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings&gt;`_ .\n\n        .. versionchanged:: 1.2\n\n           When ``encoding`` is ``None``, ``errors=\"replace\"`` is passed to\n           ``open()``.

In other words, follow this section of the tutorial so that you never have to type in your github password again! Begin by activating the conda environment for this section (see Preparation above).\nconda activate git-eager\nNext, generate your own ssh key, replacing the email below with your own address.\nssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"your_email@example.com\"\nI recommend saving the file to the default location and skipping passphrase setup. To do this, simply press enter without typing anything.\nYou should now (hopefully!) have generated an ssh key. To check that it worked, run the following commands to list the files containing your public and private keys and check that the ssh program is running.\ncd ~/.ssh/\nls id*\neval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"\nNow you need to give ssh your key to record:\nssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed15519\nNext, open your webbrowser and navigate to your github account. Go to settings -&gt; SSH & GPG Keys -&gt; New SSH Key. Give you key a title and paste the public key that you just generated on your local machine.\ncat ~/.ssh/id_ed15519\nFinally, press Add SSH key. To check that it worked, run the following command on your local machine. You should see a message telling you that you’ve successfully authenticated.\nssh -T git@github.com\nFor more information about setting up the SSH key, including instructions for different operating systems, check out github’s documentation: https://docs.github.com/es/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent."

First, we will learn to clone a remote repository onto your local machine. Navigate to your new repo, select the Code dropdown menu, select SSH, and copy the address as shown below.\n\nBack at your command line, clone the repo as follows:\ngit clone git@github.com:meganemichel/vigilant-octo-journey.git\nNext, let’s add a new or modified file to our ‘staging area’ on our local machine.\ncd vigilant-octo-journey\necho \"test_file\" &gt; file_A.txt\necho \"Just an example repo\" &gt;&gt; README.md\ngit add file_A.txt\nNow we can check what files have been locally changed, staged, etc. with status.\ngit status\nYou should see that file_A.txt is staged to be committed, but README.md is NOT. Try adding README.md and check the status again.\nNow we need to package or save the changes into a commit with a message describing the changes we’ve made. Each commit comes with a unique hash ID and will be stored forever in git history.\ngit commit -m \"Add example file\"\nFinally, let’s push our local commit back to our remote repository.\ngit push\nWhat if we want to download new commits from our remote to our local repository?\ngit pull\nYou should see that your repository is already up-to-date, since we have not made new changes to the remote repo. Let’s try making a change to the remote repository’s README file (as below). Then, back on the command line, pull the repository again."

Historically taxonomy was determined by growth characteristics and cell properties, and more recently through genomic and genetic similarity.\nThe genomic content of microbial taxa, specifically the presence or absence of genes, determine how those taxa interact with their environment, including all the biochemical processes they participate in, both internally and externally. Strains within any microbial species may have different genetic content and therefore may behave strikingly differently in the same environment, which cannot be determined through taxonomic profiling. Functionally profiling a microbial community, or determining all of the genes present independent of the species they are derived from, reveals the biochemical reactions and metabolic products the community may perform and produce, respectively.\nThis approach may provide insights to community activity and environmental interactions that are hidden when using taxonomic approaches alone. In this chapter we will perform functional profiling of metagenomic communities to assess their genetic content and inferred metabolic pathways."

Furthermore, we will then learn how we can actually evaluate what organisms we might have assembled and whether we obtained enough data to reconstruct a whole metagenome-assembled genome.

Data pre-processing\nBefore starting to analyze our data, we will need to pre-process them to remove reads mapping to the host genome, here, Homo sapiens\nTo do so, I’ve used nf-core/eager\nI’ve already pre-processed the data, and the resulting cleaned files are available in the data/eager_cleaned, but the basic eager command to do so is:\nnextflow run nf-core/eager -profile &lt;docker/singularity/podman/conda/institute&gt; --input '*_R{1,2}.fastq.gz' \\\n--fasta 'human_genome.fasta' --hostremoval_input_fastq\n\n\n10.3.3 2. Adapter sequence trimming and low-quality bases trimming\nSequencing adapters are small DNA sequences adding prior to DNA sequencing to allow the DNA fragments to attach to the sequencing flow cells. Because these adapters could interfere with downtstream analyses, we need to remove them before proceeding any further. Furthermore, because the quality of the sequencing is not always optimal, we need to remove bases of lower sequencing quality to might lead to spurious results in downstream analyses.\nTo perform both of these tasks, we’ll use the program fastp.\n! fastp -h\noption needs value: --html\nusage: fastp [options] ...\noptions:\n  -i, --in1                            read1 input file name (string [=])\n  -o, --out1                           read1 output file name (string [=])\n  -I, --in2                            read2 input file name (string [=])\n  -O, --out2                           read2 output file name (string [=])\n      --unpaired1                      for PE input, if read1 passed QC but read2 not, it will be written to unpaired1.\n                                       Default is to discard it.

This correspond to the default analysis type (-t rel_ab).\n\n*  Profiling a metagenome from raw reads:\n$ metaphlan metagenome.fastq --input_type fastq -o profiled_metagenome.txt\n\n*  You can take advantage of multiple CPUs and save the intermediate BowTie2 output for re-running\n   MetaPhlAn extremely quickly:\n$ metaphlan metagenome.fastq --bowtie2out metagenome.bowtie2.bz2 --nproc 5 --input_type fastq -o profiled_metagenome.txt\n\n*  If you already mapped your metagenome against the marker DB (using a previous MetaPhlAn run), you\n   can obtain the results in few seconds by using the previously saved --bowtie2out file and\n   specifying the input (--input_type bowtie2out):\n$ metaphlan metagenome.bowtie2.bz2 --nproc 5 --input_type bowtie2out -o profiled_metagenome.txt\n\n*  bowtie2out files generated with MetaPhlAn versions below 3 are not compatibile.\n   Starting from MetaPhlAn 3.0, the BowTie2 ouput now includes the size of the profiled metagenome and the average read length.\n   If you want to re-run MetaPhlAn using these file you should provide the metagenome size via --nreads:\n$ metaphlan metagenome.bowtie2.bz2 --nproc 5 --input_type bowtie2out --nreads 520000 -o profiled_metagenome.txt\n\n*  You can also provide an externally BowTie2-mapped SAM if you specify this format with\n   --input_type. Two steps: first apply BowTie2 and then feed MetaPhlAn with the obtained sam:\n$ bowtie2 --sam-no-hd --sam-no-sq --no-unal --very-sensitive -S metagenome.sam -x \\\n  ${mpa_dir}/metaphlan_databases/mpa_v30_CHOCOPhlAn_201901 -U metagenome.fastq\n$ metaphlan metagenome.sam --input_type sam -o profiled_metagenome.txt\n\n*  We can also natively handle paired-end metagenomes, and, more generally, metagenomes stored in\n  multiple files (but you need to specify the --bowtie2out parameter):\n$ metaphlan metagenome_1.fastq,metagenome_2.fastq --bowtie2out metagenome.bowtie2.bz2 --nproc 5 --input_type fastq\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n========== Marker level analysis ============================\n\nMetaPhlAn introduces the capability of characterizing organisms at the strain level using non\naggregated marker information. Such capability comes with several slightly different flavours and\nare a way to perform strain tracking and comparison across multiple samples.\nUsually, MetaPhlAn is first ran with the default -t to profile the species present in\nthe community, and then a strain-level profiling can be performed to zoom-in into specific species\nof interest. This operation can be performed quickly as it exploits the --bowtie2out intermediate\nfile saved during the execution of the default analysis type.\n\n*  The following command will output the abundance of each marker with a RPK (reads per kilo-base)\n   higher 0.0. (we are assuming that metagenome_outfmt.bz2 has been generated before as\n   shown above).\n$ metaphlan -t marker_ab_table metagenome_outfmt.bz2 --input_type bowtie2out -o marker_abundance_table.txt\n   The obtained RPK can be optionally normalized by the total number of reads in the metagenome\n   to guarantee fair comparisons of abundances across samples. The number of reads in the metagenome\n   needs to be passed with the '--nreads' argument\n\n*  The list of markers present in the sample can be obtained with '-t marker_pres_table'\n$ metaphlan -t marker_pres_table metagenome_outfmt.bz2 --input_type bowtie2out -o marker_abundance_table.txt\n   The --pres_th argument (default 1.0) set the minimum RPK value to consider a marker present\n\n*  The list '-t clade_profiles' analysis type reports the same information of '-t marker_ab_table'\n   but the markers are reported on a clade-by-clade basis.\n$ metaphlan -t clade_profiles metagenome_outfmt.bz2 --input_type bowtie2out -o marker_abundance_table.txt\n\n*  Finally, to obtain all markers present for a specific clade and all its subclades, the\n   '-t clade_specific_strain_tracker' should be used. For example, the following command\n   is reporting the presence/absence of the markers for the B. fragilis species and its strains\n   the optional argument --min_ab specifies the minimum clade abundance for reporting the markers\n\n$ metaphlan -t clade_specific_strain_tracker --clade s__Bacteroides_fragilis metagenome_outfmt.bz2 --input_typ\n  bowtie2out -o marker_abundance_table.txt\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\npositional arguments:\n  INPUT_FILE            the input file can be:\n                        * a fastq file containing metagenomic reads\n                        OR\n                        * a BowTie2 produced SAM file.\n                        OR\n                        * an intermediary mapping file of the metagenome generated by a previous MetaPhlAn run\n                        If the input file is missing, the script assumes that the input is provided using the standard\n                        input, or named pipes.\n                        IMPORTANT: the type of input needs to be specified with --input_type\n  OUTPUT_FILE           the tab-separated output file of the predicted taxon relative abundances\n                        [stdout if not present]\n\nRequired arguments:\n  --input_type {fastq,fasta,bowtie2out,sam}\n                        set whether the input is the FASTA file of metagenomic reads or\n                        the SAM file of the mapping of the reads against the MetaPhlAn db.\n\nMapping arguments:\n  --force               Force profiling of the input file by removing the bowtie2out file\n  --bowtie2db METAPHLAN_BOWTIE2_DB\n                        Folder containing the MetaPhlAn database.

    "text": "Genome Mapping\nAn important step in the reconstruction of full genomic sequences is mapping. Even relatively short genomes usually cannot be sequenced as a single consecutive piece. Instead, millions of short sequence reads are generated from genomic fragments. These reads can be several hundred nucleotides in length but are considerably shorter for ancient DNA (aDNA).\nFor many applications involving comparative genomics these ‘reads’ have to be aligned to one or multiple already-reconstructed reference genomes in order to identify differences between the sequenced genome and any given contextual dataset. Aligning millions of short reads to much longer genome sequences in a time-efficient and accurate manner is a bioinformatics challenge for which numerous algorithms and tools have been developed. Each of these programs comes with a variety of parameters that can significantly alter the results and default settings are often not optimal when working with aDNA. Furthermore, read mapping procedures are often part of complex computational genomics pipelines and are therefore not directly applied by many users.\nIn this chapter we will take a look at specific challenges during read mapping when dealing with aDNA. We will get an overview of common input and output formats and manually apply a read mapper to aDNA data studying the direct effects of variation in mapping parameters. We will conclude the session with an outlook on genotyping, which is an important follow-up analysis step, that in turn is very relevant for down-stream analyses such as phylogenetics."

    "section": "13.2 Mapping to a Reference Genome",
    "text": "13.2 Mapping to a Reference Genome\nOne way of reconstructing genomic information from DNA sequencing reads is mapping/aligning them to a reference genome. This allows for identification of differences between the genome from your sample and the reference genome. This information can be used for example for comparative analyses such as in phylogenetics. For a detailed explanation of the read alignment problem and an overview of concepts for solving it, please see https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-genom-090413-025358.\nIn this session we will map two samples to the Yersinia pestis (plague) genome using different parameter sets. We will do this “manually” in the sense that we will use all necessary commands one by one in the terminal. These commands usually run in the back when you apply DNA sequencing data processing pipelines.\n\n13.2.1 Preparation\nThe data and conda environment .yaml file for this practical session can be downloaded from here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6983174. See instructions on page.\nWe will open a terminal and then navigate to the working directory of this session:\ncd /&lt;path&gt;/&lt;to&gt;/4b-genome-mapping/\nThen, we need to activate the conda environment of this session. By this all the necessary tools can be accessed in the current terminal session:\nconda activate microbial-genomics\nWe will be using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (Li et al. 2009 – http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net). There are different algorithms implemented for different types of data (e.g. different read lengths). Here, we use BWA backtrack (bwa aln), which is well suitable for Illumina sequences up to 100bp. Other algorithms are bwa mem and bwa sw for longer reads.\n\n\n13.2.2 Reference Genome\nFor mapping we need a reference genome in FASTA format. Ideally we use a genome from the same species that our data relates to or, if not available, a closely related species. The selection of the correct reference genome is highly relevant. E.g. if the chosen genome differs too much from the organism the data relates to, it might not be possible to map most of the reads. Reference genomes can be retrieved from comprehensive databases such as NCBI.\nIn your directory, you can find 2 samples and your reference. As a first step we will index our reference genome (make sure you are inside your directory).\nThe first index we will generate is for bwa.\nbwa index YpestisCO92.fa\nThe second index will be used by the genome browser we will apply to our results later on:\nsamtools faidx YpestisCO92.fa\nWe need to build a third index that is necessary for the genotyping step, which comes later after mapping:\npicard CreateSequenceDictionary R=YpestisCO92.fa\n\n\n13.2.3 Mapping Parameters\nWe will be using bwa aln, but we need to specify parameters. For now we will concentrate on the “seed length” and the “maximum edit distance”. We will use the default setting for all other parameters during this session. The choice of the right parameters depend on many factors such as the type of data and the specific use case. One aspect is the mapping sensitivity, i.e. how different a read can be from the chosen reference and still be mapped. In this context we generally differentiate between strict and lenient mapping parameters.\nAs many other mapping algorithms bwa uses a so-called “seed-and-extend” approach. I.e. it initially maps the first N nucleotides of each read to the genome with relatively few mismatches and thereby determines candidate positions for the more time-intensive full alignment.\nA short seed length will generate more such candidate positions and therefore mapping will take longer, but it will also be more sensitive, i.e. there can be more differences between the read and the genome. Long seeds are less sensitive but the mapping procedure is faster.\nIn this session we will use the following two parameter sets:\nLenient\nAllow for more mismatches → -n 0.01\nShort seed length → -l 16\nStrict\nAllow for less mismatches → -n 0.1\nLong seed length → -l 32\nWe will be working with pre-processed files (sample1.fastq.gz, sample2.fastq.gz), i.e. any quality filtering and removal of sequencing adapters is already done.\nWe will map each file once with lenient and once with strict parameters. For this, we will make 4 separate directories, to avoid mixing up files:\nmkdir sample1_lenient sample2_lenient sample1_strict sample2_strict\n\n\n13.2.4 Mapping Sample1\nLet’s begin with a lenient mapping of sample1.\nGo into the corresponding folder:\ncd sample1_lenient\nPerform the bwa alignment, here for sample1, and specify lenient mapping parameters:\nbwa aln -n 0.01 -l 16 ../YpestisCO92.fa ../sample1.fastq.gz &gt; reads_file.sai\nProceed with writing the mapping in sam format (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAM_(file_format)):\nbwa samse -r '@RG\\tID:all\\tLB:NA\\tPL:illumina\\tPU:NA\\tSM:NA' ../YpestisCO92.fa reads_file.sai ../sample1.fastq.gz &gt; reads_mapped.sam\nNote that we have specified the sequencing platform (Illumina) by creating a so-called “Read Group” (-r). This information is used later during the genotyping step.\nConvert SAM file to binary format (BAM file):\nsamtools view -b -S reads_mapped.sam &gt; reads_mapped.bam\nFor processing of sam and bam files we use SAMtools (Li et al. 2009 – http://samtools.sourceforge.net/).\n-b specifies to output in BAM format. (-S specifies input is SAM, can be omitted in recent versions.)\nNow we sort the bam file → Sort alignments by leftmost coordinates:\nsamtools sort reads_mapped.bam &gt; reads_mapped_sorted.bam\nThe sorted bam file needs to be indexed → more efficient for further processing:\nsamtools index reads_mapped_sorted.bam\nDeduplication → Removal of reads from duplicated fragments:\nsamtools rmdup -s reads_mapped_sorted.bam reads_mapped_sorted_dedup.bam\nsamtools index reads_mapped_sorted_dedup.bam\nDuplicated reads are usually a consequence of amplification of the DNA fragments in the lab. Therefore, they are not biologically meaningful.\nWe have now completed the mapping procedure. Let’s have a look at our mapping results:\nsamtools view reads_mapped_sorted_dedup.bam | less -S\n(exit by pressing q)\nWe can also get a summary about the number of mapped reads. For this we use the samtools idxstats command (http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools-idxstats.html):\nsamtools idxstats reads_mapped_sorted_dedup.bam\n\n\n13.2.5 Genotyping\nThe next step we need to perform is genotyping, i.e. the identification of all SNPs that differentiate the sample from the reference. For this we use the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) (DePristo et al. 2011 – http://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/)\nIt uses the reference genome and the mapping as input and produces an output in Variant Call Format (VCF) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variant_Call_Format).\nPerform genotyping on the mapping file:\ngatk3 -T UnifiedGenotyper -R ../YpestisCO92.fa -I reads_mapped_sorted_dedup.bam --output_mode EMIT_ALL_SITES -o mysnps.vcf\nLet’s have a look…\ncat mysnps.vcf | less -S\n(exit by pressing q)\n\n\n13.2.6 Mapping and Genotyping for the other Samples/Parameters\nLet’s now continue with mapping and genotyping for the other samples and parameter settings.\n\n13.2.6.1 Sample2 Lenient\ncd ..\ncd sample2_lenient\n\nbwa aln -n 0.01 -l 16 ../YpestisCO92.fa ../sample2.fastq.gz &gt; reads_file.sai\n\nbwa samse -r '@RG\\tID:all\\tLB:NA\\tPL:illumina\\tPU:NA\\tSM:NA' ../YpestisCO92.fa reads_file.sai ../sample2.fastq.gz &gt; reads_mapped.sam\n\nsamtools view -b -S reads_mapped.sam &gt; reads_mapped.bam\n\nsamtools sort reads_mapped.bam &gt; reads_mapped_sorted.bam\n\nsamtools index reads_mapped_sorted.bam\n\nsamtools rmdup -s reads_mapped_sorted.bam reads_mapped_sorted_dedup.bam\n\nsamtools index reads_mapped_sorted_dedup.bam\n\ngatk3 -T UnifiedGenotyper -R ../YpestisCO92.fa -I reads_mapped_sorted_dedup.bam --output_mode EMIT_ALL_SITES -o mysnps.vcf\n\n\n13.2.6.2 Sample1 Strict\ncd ..\ncd sample1_strict\n\nbwa aln -n 0.1 -l 32 ../YpestisCO92.fa ../sample1.fastq.gz &gt; reads_file.sai\n\nbwa samse -r '@RG\\tID:all\\tLB:NA\\tPL:illumina\\tPU:NA\\tSM:NA' ../YpestisCO92.fa reads_file.sai ../sample1.fastq.gz &gt; reads_mapped.sam\n\nsamtools view -b -S reads_mapped.sam &gt; reads_mapped.bam\n\nsamtools sort reads_mapped.bam &gt; reads_mapped_sorted.bam\n\nsamtools index reads_mapped_sorted.bam\n\nsamtools rmdup -s reads_mapped_sorted.bam reads_mapped_sorted_dedup.bam\n\nsamtools index reads_mapped_sorted_dedup.bam\n\ngatk3 -T UnifiedGenotyper -R ../YpestisCO92.fa -I reads_mapped_sorted_dedup.bam --output_mode EMIT_ALL_SITES -o mysnps.vcf\n\n\n13.2.6.3 Sample2 Strict\ncd ..\ncd sample2_strict\n\nbwa aln -n 0.1 -l 32 ../YpestisCO92.fa ../sample2.fastq.gz &gt; reads_file.sai\n\nbwa samse -r '@RG\\tID:all\\tLB:NA\\tPL:illumina\\tPU:NA\\tSM:NA' ../YpestisCO92.fa reads_file.sai ../sample2.fastq.gz &gt; reads_mapped.sam\n\nsamtools view -b -S reads_mapped.sam &gt; reads_mapped.bam\n\nsamtools sort reads_mapped.bam &gt; reads_mapped_sorted.bam\n\nsamtools index reads_mapped_sorted.bam\n\nsamtools rmdup -s reads_mapped_sorted.bam reads_mapped_sorted_dedup.bam\n\nsamtools index reads_mapped_sorted_dedup.bam\n\ngatk3 -T UnifiedGenotyper -R ../YpestisCO92.fa -I reads_mapped_sorted_dedup.bam --output_mode EMIT_ALL_SITES -o mysnps.vcf\n\n\n\n13.2.7 Comparing Genotypes\nIn order to combine the results from multiple samples and parameter settings we need to agregate and comparatively analyse the information from all the vcf files. For this we will use the software MultiVCFAnalyzer (https://github.com/alexherbig/MultiVCFAnalyzer).\nIt produces various output files and summary statistics and can integrate gene annotations for SNP effect analysis as done by the program SnpEff (Cingolani et al. 2012 - http://snpeff.sourceforge.net/).\nRun MultiVCFAnalyzer on all 4 files at once. First cd one level up (if you type ls you should see your 4 directories, reference, etc.):\ncd ..\nThen make a new directory…\nmkdir vcf_out\n…and run the programme:\nmultivcfanalyzer NA YpestisCO92.fa NA vcf_out F 30 3 0.9 0.9 NA sample1_lenient/mysnps.vcf sample1_strict/mysnps.vcf sample2_lenient/mysnps.vcf sample2_strict/mysnps.vcf\nLet’s have a look in the ‘vcf_out’ directory (cd into it):\ncd vcf_out\nCheck the parameters we set earlier:\nless -S info.txt\n(exit by pressing q)\nCheck results:\nless -S snpStatistics.tsv\n(exit by pressing q)\nThe file content should look like this:\nSNP statistics for 4 samples.\nQuality Threshold: 30.0\nCoverage Threshold: 3\nMinimum SNP allele frequency: 0.9\nsample  SNP Calls (all) SNP Calls (het) coverage(fold)  coverage(percent)\nrefCall allPos  noCall  discardedRefCall    discardedVarCall    filteredVarCall unhandledGenotype\nsample1_lenient 213 0   16.38   92.69\n4313387 4653728 293297  46103   728 0   0\nsample1_strict  207 0   16.33   92.71\n4314060 4653728 293403  45633   425 0   0\nsample2_lenient 1274    0   9.01    83.69\n3893600 4653728 453550  297471  7829    0   4\nsample2_strict  1218    0   8.94    83.76\n3896970 4653728 455450  295275  4815    0   0\nFirst we find the most important parameter settings and then the table of results. The first column contains the dataset name and the second column the number of called SNPs. The genome coverage and the fraction of the genome covered with the used threshold can be found in columns 4 and 5, respectively. For example, sample1 had 207 SNP calls with strict parameters. The coverage is about 16-fold and about 93% of the genome are covered 3 fold or higher (The coverage threshold we set was 3).\n\n\n13.2.8 Exploring the Results\nFor visual exploration of mapping results so-called “Genome Browsers” are used. Here we will use the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) (https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/).\nTo open IGV, simply type the following command and the app will open:\nigv\nNote that you cannot use the terminal while IGV is open. If you want to use it anyways, open a second terminal via the bar on the bottom.\nLoad your reference (YpestisCO92.fa):\n→ Genomes → Load Genome from File\n\nLoad your bam files (do this 4 times, once for each mapping):\n→ File → Load from File\n\nTry to explore the mapping results yourself. Here are some questions to guide you. Please also have a look at the examples below.\nWhat differences do you observe between the samples and parameters?\nDifferences in number of mapped reads, coverage, number of SNPs\nDo you see any global patterns?\nWhich sample is more affected by changing the parameters?\nWhich of the two samples might be ancient, which is modern?\nLet’s examine some SNPs. Have a look at snpTable.tsv.\nCan you identify SNPs that were called with lenient but not with strict parameters or vice versa?\nLet’s check out some of these in IGV. Do you observe certain patterns in these genomic regions?\n\n\n13.2.9 Examples\nPlease find here a few examples for exploration. To get a better visualization we have loaded here only sample2_lenient (top track) and sample2_strict (bottom track):\n\nYou can see all aligned reads in the current genomic region as stacks of grey arrows. In the middle of the image you see brown dashes in all of the reads. This is a SNP. You also see sporadically green or red dashes in some reads but not all of them at a given position. These sporadic differences are DNA damage such as we typically find it for ancient DNA.\nFor jumping to a specific coordinate you need to enter it into the coordinate field at the top:\n\nE.g. if you enter 12326942 after the colon in the coordinate field and hit enter, you will jump to the same position as in the screenshot above.\nLet’s have a look at some positions.\nFor example position 36472:\n\nIn the middle of the image you see a SNP (T) that was called with strict parameters (bottom) but not with lenient parameters (top). But why would it not be called in the top track? It is not called because there are three reads that cover the same position, but do not contain the T. We can see that these reads have other difference to the reference at other positions. That’s why they are not mapped with strict parameters. It is quite likely that they originate from a different species. This example demonstrates that sensitive mapping parameters might actually lead to a loss of certain SNP calls.\nDoes this mean that stricter parameters will always give us a clean mapping? Let’s have a look at position 219200:\n\nYou might need to zoom out a bit using the slider in the upper right corner.\nSo, what is going on here? We see a lot of variation in most of the reads. This is reduced a bit with strict mapping parameters (bottom track) but the effect is still quite pronounced. Here, we see a region that seems to be conserved in other species as well, so we have a lot of mapping from other organisms. We can’t compensate that with stricter mapping parameters and we would have to apply some filtering on genotype level to remove this variation from our genotyping. Removing false positive SNP calls is important as it would interfere with downstream analysis such as phylogenomics.\nSuch regions can be fairly large. For example, see this 20 kb region around position 224750:\n\n\n\n13.2.10 Conclusions\n\nMapping DNA sequencing reads to a reference genome is a complex procedure that requires multiple steps.\nMapping results are the basis for genotyping, i.e. the detection of differences to the reference.\nThe genotyping results can be aggregated from multiple samples and comparatively analysed e.g. in the context of phylogenomics.\nThe chosen mapping parameters can have a strong influence on the results of any downstream analysis.\nThis is particularly true when dealing with ancient DNA samples as they tend to contain DNA from multiple organisms. This can lead to mismapped reads and therefore incorrect genotypes, which can further influence downstream analyses."

    "text": "14.3 Basic concepts in phylogenomics\nBefore we start building trees, we are going to recap a few basic concepts in phylogenomics.\n\n14.3.1 What is a phylogenetic tree\nThe Oxford Dictionary defines phylogenetics as “the branch of biology that deals with phylogeny, especially with the deduction of the historical relationships between groups of organisms”.\nWhen we are building/computing a phylogeny we are inferring the relationship between organisms based on a set of homologous characters, which are characters that have been inherited from a common ancestor. Those characters can be morphological, which is common in paleontological studies, or molecular characters, which in our case they will be DNA sequences.\nTo display the relationships between the organism we use phylogenetic trees, which are composed of different elements.\n\n\n14.3.2 Parts of a phylogenetic tree: Nodes and Branches\nA phylogenetic tree has different parts:\n\nThe tips, which can also be called leaves, represent the sampled “individuals”. Each of the sequences that you used to reconstruct a tree will be displayed in your tree as tips. In the example, we used sequences A,B,C,D and E, and those appear at the tips of the tree.\nA node in the tree represents an ancestor (or ancestral sequences) shared by one or more tips. In the tree we see different nodes displayed, the most rightwards ones represent the ancestors between A and B; and C and D, and if we move toward the left we will see a node representing the ancestor of A,B,C and D, and the most leftwards node represent the common ancestor of all the sequences in our tree.\nBranches are the part of the tree that connects each node to other nodes or to the leaves. These represent evolutionary paths between nodes/leaves. The length of these branches is called branch length and it can represent different measures depending on the algorithm that you use to infer the phylogenetic tree, such as the number of changes (in the case of for example Maximum Parsimony tree, see Character-based phylogenetic methods), genetic/evolutionary distance (for Neighbour-Joining, see distance-based phylogenetic methods, or for Maximum Likelihood method, see Character-based phylogenetic methods), or the time between two taxa or nodes (for example, trees inferred by BEAST, see Bayesian phylogenetic inference using BEAST2).\n\n\n\n\n14.3.3 Types of trees: Ultrametric vs. non-ultrametric\nWe can have different types of trees depending on how the distance to the root (represents the ancestor shared by all the taxa in the tree):\n\nIn ultrametric trees the distance from the root to any of the tips in the tree is the same. One typical example of ultrametric tree will be a tree where the branch length represents time and all of our tips were samples in the present.\nIn non-ultrametric trees the distance from the root to the tips differ from tip to tip. We will find this type of tree when we use algorithms where the branch lengths are calculated based on genetic distance/number of changes."

    "section": "14.4 The start: DNA sequence alignment",
    "text": "14.4 The start: DNA sequence alignment\n\n14.4.1 DNA sequence aligment\nFor this course, our start would be a DNA sequence alignment, however phylogenies can be built using any other source of information that contain homologous characters, such as phenotypic characters inherited from the same ancestor, protein sequences, etc.\nWe start by collecting the DNA sequences of our organisms/individuals of interest, and now we need to make sure that the positions are homologous, which means that they were inherited from the same ancestor, to ensure that they share the same evolutionary history. A way to ensure that our positions are homologous is by aligning our DNA sequences.\nThere are different ways to produce an alignment from our sequences, and this will depend on the type of data that you have:\n\nMultiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) can be computed from complete genomes. This can be achieved with MAFFT or Clustal Omega. However, this will be computationally expensive to perform on large genomes.\nReference based alignment: this consists of aligning your reads to a reference genome, and it was covered during the Practical 4B: Genome mapping.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor large genomic datasets, we often use Single Nucleotide Polymorphims (SNPs) alignments, i.e. alignments that contain only variable genomic positions. This is to reduce the computational time since the variable positions are the most informative for reconstructing phylogenetic trees.\n\n\n\n\n14.4.2 DNA sequence alignment\nIn this practical session, we will be working with an alignment produced as you learned in the Practical 4B:Genome mapping.\nWe are going to start by exploring the alignment in MEGA. So open the MEGA desktop application and load the alignment by clicking on File -&gt; Open A File/Session -&gt; Select the snpAligment_session5.fasta.\n\nIt will you ask what you want to do with the alignment. In MEGA you can also produce an alignment, however, since our sequences are already aligned we will press on Analyze.\nThen we will select Nucleotide Sequences since we are working with a DNA alignment. Note that MEGA can also work with Protein Sequences as well as Pairwise Distance Matrix (which we will cover shortly). In the same window, we will change the character for Missing Data to N and click in OK.\n\nA window would open up asking if our alignment contains protein encoding sequences, and we will select No.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you had protein encoding sequences, you would have selected Yes. This will allow you to treat different positions with different evolutionary modes depending on their codon position. One can do this to take in account that the third codon position can change to different nucleotides without resulting in a different amino acid, while position one and two of the codon are more restricted.\n\n\nTo explore the alignment, you will then click on the box with TA\n\nYou will see an alignment containing sequences from the bacterial pathogen Yersinia pestis. Within the alignment, we have our sequences of interest (VLI092, CHC004, KZL002) that date between 5000-2000 years Before Present (BP), and we want to know how they relate to the rest of the Yersinia pestis genomes in the alignment.\n\nWhat do you think the dots represent?\n\nThey represent positions that are same as the reference\n\nWhat are the Ns in the sequences?\n\nThey represent positions where we have missing data. We told MEGA to encode missing positions as N\n\nHow many sequences are we analysing?\n\nWe are analysing 33 sequences."

    "section": "14.5 Distance-based phylogenetic methods",
    "text": "14.5 Distance-based phylogenetic methods\nDistance-based methods calculate the tree from a pairwise distance matrix. The distances in the pairwise distance matrix can represent either:\n\nNumber of differences between to sequences\np-distance that is calculated as number of differences / total number of sites\n\nFor any of the phylogenetic methods, we can also take into account that different sites may evolve differently depending on their nucleotide composition. To take this into account, you will need to use substitution models. By applying different evolutionary models, one can take into account multiple consecutive mutations as well as different probabilities to observe a specific mutation given the specific character in this position. There are tools that allow you to choose the substitution model that it is more fitting to you specific alignment, such as jModelTest, ModelGenerator, etc.\n\n\n14.5.1 Calculate a pairwise distance matrix\nTo calculate a pairwise distance matrix, one will have to check the number of differences between all the possible pair combination between the sequences in the alignment, and in the case of a p-distance normalise the number of differences by the total number of sites. All this differences will be then stored in a matrix.\nMEGA also provides a function to calculate Pairwise Distances, for that you will have to click into the Distance symbol, and select Compute Pairwise Distances, the output will be a matrix with all the pairwise distances. This will be the first step you will do if you wanted to compute a distance-based phylogeny with methods such as UPGMA or Neighbour-Joining. We will be covering the second method.\n\n\n\n14.5.2 Calculating a Neighbour-Joining tree\nIn the slide you have an example on how a small Neighbour-Joining (NJ), with 6 taxa is calculated.\nIn essence, this method will be grouping taxa that have the shortest distance together first, and will be doing this iteratively until all the taxa/sequences included in your alignment have been placed in a tree. Luckily, you won’t have to do this by hand since MEGA allows you to build a NJ tree.\n\n\n14.5.3 Let’s make our own NJ tree\nFor that go back to MEGA and click on the Phylogeny symbol and then select Construct Neighbour Joining Tree. In the window that would pop up, you will then chance the Model/Method to p-distance since we want to normalise by the total number of sites shared by sequences. Then press OK and a window with the calculated phylogenetic tree will pop up.\n\nSince the tree is not easily visualised in MEGA, we will export it in newick format (an “standarised” format to write a tree in a computer-readable form) and explore our tree in FigTree. This tool has a better interface for visually manipulating trees and allows us to interact with the phylogenetic tree.\n\nTo do that you will click on File, then Export current tree (Newick) and click on Branch Lengths to include those in the newick annotation. When you press OK, a new window with the tree in newick format will pop up and you will then press File -&gt; Save and saved it as NJ_tree.nwk (If you are doing this for your own project, please give your files informative names).\nAs said above, we will explore own NJ tree in FigTree. Open the software and then open the NJ tree by clicking on File -&gt; Open and selecting the file with the NJ tree NJ_tree.nwk\n\nSo, which type of tree is this? Before you answer this question, let me introduce you to another type of trees\n\n\n14.5.4 Type of trees: Rooted vs Unrooted trees\n\nAn unrooted tree does not contain a root. It displays the relationships between our sequences but not the direction in time. In the example, we can not tell if human or chimpanzee or gorilla are more ancestral to each other.\nA rooted tree does contain a root. This root can be calculated based on the inclusion of an outgroup, a known sequenced to be older than any of the taxa in our tree, or by computational methods that can place the root by various methods, being one of such methods the Mid Point Rooting. A rooted tree represents the relationships and the direction in time. By rooting our example tree with the outgroup, we now can tell that gorilla is ancestral to both human and chimpanzees.\n\n ##### Let’s make our own NJ tree\nSo if we go back to our question, which type of tree is this?\n\nEven though a root is displayed by default, this is actually an unrooted tree. We know that Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (labelled here as Y. pseudotuberculosis) is an outgroup to Yersinia pestis. You can reroot the tree by selecting Y.pseudotuberculosis and pressing Reroot.\n\nNow we have the correct tree.\nHow many leaves/tips has our tree?\n\nThat’s right, it is 33, the same number of sequences that was in our original SNP alignment.\n\nIs it an ultrametric tree?\n\nNo, we can see that root to tip distance is different between taxa. The branch lengths in the NJ tree will represent genetic distance between the different taxa.\n\nWhere are our taxa of interest? (KZL002, GZL002, CHC004 and VLI092)\n\nThey all fall ancestral to the rest of Yersinia pestis in this tree.\n\nDo they form a clade?\n\nAll the genomes have a common ancestor and form a single branch, meaning that they form a clade.\n\nWhich type of clade?\n\nTo answer this question, let’s look at what types of clades we can have in a phylogenetic tree\n\n\n\n14.5.5 Types of Clades\n\nA Monophyletic clade is a group of taxa that contain all the taxa that share a common ancestor.\nA Paraphyletic clade is a group of taxa including all the taxa with a common recent ancestor except one or more taxa. In the example, since A is missing from the clade selected, it won’t be anymore a paraphyletic clade rather than a monophyletic. Another common example of paraphyletic clade would be selecting all the reptiles but excluding birds.\nA Polyphyletic clade is a group of taxa from different monophyletic clades.\n\n\n\n\n14.5.6 Lets make our own NJ tree\nNow regarding our question, which type of clade form KZL002, GZL002, CHC004 and VLI092?\nSince they all share a common ancestor,they form a monophyletic clade.\nUntil now we have learned how to explore a SNP alignment, the different part of the a phylogenetic tree and how to make a NJ tree. The NJ tree is based on pairwise distances, which is one of the simplest algorithms to build a tree and now you will see more complex algorithms for phylogenetic tree building."

    "text": "14.6 Character-based phylogenetic methods: maximum parsimony and probabilistic approaches\nCharacter-based methods are not based on pairwise distances but rather model the complete evolution of each character (e.g. DNA nucleotides at each position) along the phylogenetic tree.\nOne of these methods is maximum parsimony and it consists in choosing the tree that underlies an evolutionary history with the least number of character changes.\n\n\nOther types of character-based methods which are more commonly used today are probabilistic methods. In general, these are statistical techniques that are based on probabilistic models under which the data that we observe is generated following a probability distribution depending on a set of parameters which we want to estimate.\nIn a phylogenetic probabilistic model, the data is the sequence alignment and the parameters, are the substitution matrix and the phylogenetic tree. The probability of the data given the model parameters is called the likelihood.\n\n\n\n14.6.1 Maximum likelihood estimation and bootstrapping\nOne way we can make inferences from a probabilistic model is by finding the combination of parameters which maximises the likelihood. These parameter values are called maximum likelihood (ML) estimates. We are usually not able to compute the likelihood value for all possible combinations of parameters and have to rely on heuristic algorithms to find the maximum likelihood estimates.\n\nThe Maximum likelihood estimates are point estimates, i.e. single parameter values (for example, a tree), which does not allow to measure uncertainty. A classic method to measure the uncertainty of ML tree estimates is bootstrapping, which consists in repeatedly disturbing the alignment by masking sites from it and estimating a tree from each of these bootstrap alignments.\n\nFor each clade in the ML tree, a bootstrap support value is computed which corresponds to the proportion of bootstrap trees containing the clade. This gives an indication of how robustly the clade is supported by the data (i.e. whether it holds even after disturbing the dataset). Bootstrapping can be used to measure the topology uncertainty of trees estimated with any inference method.\nHere is a command to estimate an ML phylogenetic tree using RAxML (you may find the list of parameters in the RAxML manual):\nraxmlHPC-PTHREADS -m GTRGAMMA -T 3 -f a -x 12345 -p 12345 -N autoMRE -s snpAlignment_session5.fasta -n full_dataset.tre\nOnce the analysis has been completed, you can open the tree using Figtree (RAxML_bipartitions… file, change “label” to “bootstrap support” at the prompt).\nThe tree estimated using this model is a substitution tree (branch lengths represent genetic distances in subst./site), and it is not oriented in time: this is an unrooted tree (displayed with a random root in Figtree). You can reroot the tree in Figtree using Y. pseudotuberculosis as an outgroup (click on the branch leading to Y. pseudo and then “Reroot”).\nWhere do our genomes of interest from the LNBA period fall (VLI092, GZL002, CHC004, KZL002), compared to the rest of Yersinia pestis diversity? Is that placement well-supported? (look at the bootstrap support value: click on the “Node Labels” box and open the drop-down menu, change “Node ages” to “bootstrap support”)\nYou can notice that the phylogeny is difficult to visualize due to the long branch leading to Y. pseudotuberculosis. Having a very distant outgroup can also have deleterious effects on the estimated phylogeny (due to long branch attraction). We can construct a new phylogeny after removing the outgroup (go back to the alignment in mega, unclick Y.pseudotuberculosis, and export in fasta format), and then reroot the tree based on our previous knowledge: place the root on the branch leading to the LNBA genomes.\nThen, export the rooted tree: file &gt; export trees &gt; “save as currently displayed”.\n\n\n14.6.2 Estimating a time-tree using Bayesian phylogenetics\nNow, we will try to use reconstruct a phylogeny in which the branch lengths do not represent a number of mutations but instead represent the time of evolution. To do so, we will use the sample ages (C14 dates) to calibrate the tree in time. This assumes a molecular clock hypothesis in which substitutions occur at a rate that is relatively constant in time so that the time of evolution can be estimated based on the number of substitutions.\n\n14.6.2.1 Temporal signal testing\nIt is a good practice to assess if the genetic sequences that we analyse do indeed behave like molecular clocks before trying to estimate a time tree. A classic test to do this is called root-to-tip regression, which consists in verifying that the oldest a sequence is, the closer it should be to the root because there was less time for mutations to accumulate before this sequence was sampled. The correlation between sample age and distance to the root (root-to-tip regression) can be assessed using a rooted substitution tree and the program tempest:\n\nopen tempest and load the re-rooted ML tree that we produced previously\nclick on “import dates” in the “sample dates” tab, select the sample_age.txt file, and then change to “dates specified as years before the present”\nlook at the root-to-tip regression: is there a positive correlation?\n\n\n\n\n14.6.2.2 Bayesian phylogenetic inference using BEAST2\nWe will estimate a time tree from our alignment using Bayesian inference instead of maximum likelihood.\nBayesian inference is a type of inference which is based on a probability distribution that is different from the likelihood: the posterior probability. The posterior probability is the probability of the parameters given the data. The posterior distribution is easier to interpret than the likelihood because it contains all the information about the parameters: point estimates such as the median or the mean can be directly estimated from it, but also percentile intervals which can be used to measure uncertainty.\n\nThe Bayes theorem tells us that is proportional to the product of the likelihood and the “prior” probability of the data:\n\nTherefore, for Bayesian inference, we need to complement our probabilistic model with prior distributions for all the parameters. Because we want to estimate a time tree, we also add another parameter: the molecular clock (average substitution rate in time units).\n\nTo characterize the full posterior distribution of each parameter, we would need in theory to compute the posterior probability for each possible combination of parameters. This is impossible, and we will instead use an algorithm called Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to approximate the posterior distribution. The MCMC is an algorithm which iteratively samples values of the parameters from the posterior distribution. Therefore, if the MCMC has run long enough, the (marginal) posterior distribution of the parameters can be approximated by a histogram of the sampled values.\n\nThe different components of the BEAST2 analysis can be set up in the program BEAUti:\n\n\nload the alignment in the “Partitions” tab\nset the sampling dates in the “Tip dates” tab\nchoose the substitution model in the “Site model” tab\nchoose the molecular clock model in the “Clock model” tab\nchoose the prior distribution of parameters in the “Priors” tab\nset up the MCMC in the “MCMC” tab\n\n    \nThe “taming the beast” website has great tutorials to learn setting a BEAST2 analysis. In particular, the “Introduction to BEAST2”, “Prior selection” and “Time-stamped data” are good starts.\nTry running an analysis on the alignment without outgroup using the following:\n\ndon’t forget to specify the sample ages correctly\nuse a GTR substitution matrix with a Gamma site model and 4 Gamma categories\nuse a relaxed clock lognormal model with an initial value of 1E-4\nuse a Bayesian Skyline Coalescent tree prior\nchange the mean clock prior to a uniform distribution between 1E-6 and 1E-3 subst/site/year\nuse 300M iterations for the MCMC chain, and log the parameters and trees each 10,000th iteration\n\nOnce the analysis is completed, assess the posterior distribution sampling and parameter estimates by loading the obtained log file into Tracer\nFirst, look at the trace of the posterior to check if the MCMC has passed the burn-in phase, and if you have remove all burn-in iterations\n\nIf so you can look at the trace and effective sample size (ESS) value of all parameters, to check that the MCMC has run long enough. The traces should look (more or less) like a “hairy caterpillar”, and a rule of thumb is that all ESS values should be above 200. If this is not the case, you should run the MCMC longer (BEAST2 has a -resume option that you can use to extend the MCMC sampling without starting everything from the beginning).\n\nYou can then look at the estimates of your parameter in the top-right panel (mean, median, 95% HPD interval, …). Note that these are marginal estimates, i.e. integrated over all other parameters.\n\nWhat is your estimate of the substitution (mean clock) rate?\nYou can then generate a maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree using treeAnnotator.\n\nWhat is your mean estimate for the age of the common ancestor of all Yersinia pestis strains? To which parameter (displayed in beauti) does this corresponds?"

Comparison with a range of previously published data of different preservational levels can allow an estimate on the quality of the new samples. When considering solely (re)using public data, we can consider that this can also spawn new ideas, projects, and meta analyses to allow further deeper exploration of ancient metagenomic data (e.g., looking for correlations between various environmental factors and preservation).\nFortunately for us, genomicists and particularly palaeogenomicists have been very good at uploading raw sequencing data to well-established databases.\nIn the vast majority of cases you will be able to find publically available sequencing data on the INSDC association of databases, namely the EBI’s European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), and NCBI or DDBJ’s Sequence Read Archives (SRA). However, you may in some cases find ancient metagenomic data on institutional FTP servers, domain specific databases (e.g. OAGR), Zenodo, Figshare, or GitHub.\nBut while the data is publicly available, we need to ask whether it is ‘FAIR’."

Sequencing data is in most cases accessible (via the public databases like ENA, SRA), interoperable and reproducible because we use field standard formats such as FASTQ or BAM files. However Findable remains an issue.\nThis is because the metadata about each data file is dispersed over many places, and very often not with the data files themselves.\nIn this case I am referring to metadata such as: What is the sample’s name? How old is it? Where is it from? Which enzymes were used for library construction? What sequencing machine was this library sequenced on?\nTo find this information about a given data file, you have to search many places (main text, supplementary information, the database itself), for different types of metadata (as authors report different things), and also in different formats (text, tables, figures.\nThis very heterogenous landscape makes it difficult for machines to index all this information (if at all), and thus means you cannot search for the data you want to use for your own reserch in online search engines."

AncientMetagenomeDir is a resource of lists of metadata of all publishing and publically available ancient metagenomes and microbial genome-level enriched samples.\nBy aggregating and standardising metadata and accession codes of ancient metagenomic samples, the project aims to make it easier for people to find comparative data for their own projects, as well as help track the field over time and facilitate meta analyses.\nCurrently the project is split over three main tables: host-associated metagenomes (e.g. ancient microbiomes), host-associated single-genomes (e.g. ancient pathogens), and environmental metagenomes (e.g. lakebed cores or cave sediment sequences).\nThe repository already contains more than a thousand samples and span the entire globe and as far back as hundreds of thousands of years.\nTo make the lists of samples and their metadata as accessible and interoperable as possible, we utilise simple text (TSV - tab separate value) files - files that can be opened by pretty much all spreadsheet tools (e.g., Microsoft Office excel, LibreOffice Calc) and languages (R, Python etc.).\n\nCriticially, by standardising the recorded all metadata across all publications this makes it much easier for researchers to filter for particular time periods, geographical regions, or sample types of their interest - and then use the also recorded accession numbers to efficiently download the data.\nAt their core all different AncientMetagenomeDir tables must have at 6 minimum metadata sets:\n\nPublication information (doi)\nSample name(s)\nGeographic location (e.g. country, coordinates)\nAge\nSample type (e.g. bone, sediment, etc.)\nData Archive and accessions\n\nEach table then has additional columns depending on the context (e.g. what time of microbiome is expected for host-associated metagenoes, or species name of the genome that was reconstructed).\nThe AncientMetagenomeDir project already has 3 releases, and will continued to be regularly updated as the community continues to submit new metadata of samples of new publications as they come out."

Such a checklist would be interegrated into services such as the ENA or SRA, and therefore would standardise metadata alongside the raw data, and make ancient metagenomic data much more findable with search engines.\nFinally, to make it easier for researchers who are not familiar with sequencing database infrastucture, we are in the process of building a new tool (something already in a usable state) called AMDirT. This allows a web browser-based GUI to filter and select data, and produce scripts for you to download all the selected data (without having to go to the databases themselves).\nThis is something we are going to try out now!"

Make sure to run on your local laptop/PC or on a server with X11 forwarding\n\n\nOpen your terminal, and run the following two commands:\nconda activate git-eager\npip install --upgrade --force-reinstall git+https://github.com/SPAAM-community/AMDirT.git@dev\nOnce that (hopefully) installs correctly, we can load the tool by running\nAMDirT filter\nYour web browser should now load, and you should see a two panel page.\n\nUnder Select a table use the dropdown menu to select ‘ancientsinglegenome-hostassociated’.\nYou should then see a table, pretty similar what you are familiar with with spreadsheet tools such as Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice calc.\n\nTo navigate, you can scroll down to see more rows, and press shift and scroll to see more columns, or use click on a cell and use your arrow keys (⬆,⬇,⬅,➡) to move around the table.\nYou can reorder columns by clicking on the column name, and also filter by pressing the little ‘burger’ icon that appears on the column header when you hover over a given column.\nAs an exercise, we will try filtering to a particular set of samples, then generate some download scripts, and download the files.\nFirst, filter the project_name column to ‘Kocher2021’.\n\nThen scroll to the right, and filter the geo_loc_name to ‘United Kingdom’.\n\nYou should be left with 4 rows.\nFinally, scroll back to the first column and tick the boxes of these four samples.\n\nOnce you’ve selected the samples you want, you can press Validate selection. You should then see a series loading-spinner, and new buttons should appear!\n\nYou should have three main buttons:\n\nDownload Curl sample download script\nDownload nf-core/eager input TSV\nDownload Citations as BibText\n\nThe first button is for generating a download script that will allow you to immediately download all sequencing data of the samples you selected. The second button is a pre-configured input file for use in the nf-core/eager ancient DNA pipeline, and finally, the third button generates a text file with (in most cases) all the citations of the data you downloaded, in a format accepted by most reference/citation managers.\nIt’s important to note you are not necessarily restricted to Curl for downloading the data, or nf-core/eager for running the files. AMDirT aims to add support for whatever tools or pipelines requested by the community. For example, an already supported download alternative is with the nf-core/fetchNGS pipeline. You can select these using the drop-down menus on the left hand-side.\nPress the three buttons to make sure you download the files. And once this is done, you can close the tab of the web browser, and in the terminal you can press ctrl + c to shutdown the tool."

It is a reimplementation of the previously published EAGER (Efficient Ancient Genome Reconstruction) pipeline (Peltzer et al. 2016) using Nextflow. The nf-core/eager pipeline was designed with the following aims in mind:\n\nPortability- In order for our analyses to be reproducible, others should be able to easily implement our computational pipelines. nf-core/eager is highly portable, providing easy access to pipeline tools and facilitating use across multiple platforms. nf-core eager utilizes Docker, Conda, and Singularity for containerization, enabling distrubition of the pipeline in a self-contained bundle containing all the code, packages, and libraries needed to run it.\nReproducibility- nf-core/eager uses custom configuration profiles to specify both HPC-level parameters and analyses-specific options. These profiles can be shared alongside your publication, making it easier for others to reproduce your methodology!\nNew Tools- Finally, nf-core/eager includes additional, novel methods and tools for analysis of ancient DNA data that were not included in previous versions. This is especially good news for folks interested in microbial sciences, who can take advantage of new analytical pathways for metagenomic analysis and pathogen screening."

For more information, check out the usage documentation here.\nBriefly, nf-core/eager takes standard input file types that are shared across the genomics field, including raw fastq files, aligned reads in bam format, and a reference fasta. nf-core/eager can perform preprocessing of this raw data, including adapter clipping, read merging, and quality control of adapter-trimmed data. Note that input files can be specified using wildcards OR a standardized tsv format file; the latter facilitates streamlined integration of multpile data types within a single EAGER run! More on this later.\nnf-core/eager facilitates mapping using a variety of field-standard alignment tools with configurable parameters. An exciting new addition in nf-core/eager also enables analysis of off-target host DNA for all of you metagenomics folks out there. Be sure to check out the functionality available for metagenomic profiling (blue route in the ‘tube map’ above).\nnf-core/eager incorporates field-standard quality control tools designed for use with ancient DNA so that you can easily evaluate the success of your experiments. Multiple genotyping approaches and additional analyses are available depending on your input datatype, organism, and research questions. Importantly, all of these processes generate data that we need to compile and analyze in a coherent way. nf-core eager uses MultiQC. to create an integrated html report that summarizes the output/results from each of the pipeline steps.
