## Section

First section.
One sentence _per line_.
Emphasis should be with italics via underscores

New paragraph through a _line break_ above.

Lists can be rendered with hyphens as bullets, and 4 spaces for sub-bullets:

- Bullet 1
- Bullet 2
    - Sub-bullet 1
    - Sub-bullet 2
- Bullet 3

### Sub section

Here is an example of a code block. The line before must end in a full stop.

```{bash}
echo "Hello world!"
```

The code block above has `bash` as the code identifier. Inline text should only be used for single commands, file extensions, or paths, i.e., not whole commands.

Large or long running code should be set to `eval` false, and pre-made output placed in a collapsible block.

```{.bash eval=false}
echo "SPAAM rules!"
```
::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Expand see output

```{.bash eval=false}
SPAAM rules!
```
:::

## Second section

Here is an example of a figure. It must have a caption, and a label for referencing in text.

![The figure caption goes here](assets/images/figure-template.png){#fig-chaptertempalte-figuretemplate}

The label must be prefixed with `fig-<chaptername>-<figureidentifier>` and should be in lowercase.

## Third section

Tables should also have a caption and a label for referencing in text.

| Default | Left | Right | Center |
|---------|:-----|------:|:------:|
| 12      | 12   |    12 |   12   |
| 123     | 123  |   123 |  123   |
| 1       | 1    |     1 |   1    |

### Third sub section

::: {.callout-warning}
This is a call out block with a warning style.

Note that we reserve some callout formatting styles for specific objects!
:::

For example the end of every _section_ should have a task or question with a hidden answer.

::: {.callout-tip title="Question" appearance="simple"}
Your question(s) goes here.
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Answer"}
The answer(s) goes here, in a by-default 'hidden' block the reader can open to view.
:::
