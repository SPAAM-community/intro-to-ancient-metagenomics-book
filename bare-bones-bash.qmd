For this chapter's exercises, if not already performed, you will need to create the [conda environment](before-you-start.qmd#creating-a-conda-environment) from the `yml` file in the following [link](https://github.com/SPAAM-community/intro-to-ancient-metagenomics-book/raw/main/assets/envs/bare-bones-bash.yml) (right click and save as to download), and once created, activate the environment with:

```bash
conda activate bare-bones-bash
```

This is the Brief version of a more Broad two-part session that we gave in 2022,
which can be found [here](https://spaam-community.github.io/wss-summer-school/#/2022/day-1?id=practical-1b-bare-bones-bash-1).
The teaching material for the Boundless Bare Bones Bash (Basic + Boosted) can be
found in the [Bare Bones Bash website](https://barebonesbash.github.io/#/).

### tl;dr
<details>
Below is a quick reference guide to the commands discussed in this tutorial.
To understand actually what each command does, carry on reading below!
For a complete run of all these commands AND MORE(!!),
consider following the full Bare Bones Bash walkthroughs [here](https://barebonesbash.github.io/#/).

### Introduction

The aim of this tutorial is to make you familiar with using bash everyday... 
for the rest of your life! More specifically, we want 
to do this in the context of bioinformatics. We will start with how to navigate 
around a filesystem in the terminal, download sequencing files, and then to
manipulate these. Within these sections we will also show you simple tips and
tricks to make your life generally easier.

This tutorial is designed so you follow along on any machine with a UNIX
terminal (no warranty provided).

### The 5 commandments of Bare Bones Bash

The Bare Bones Bash philosophy of learning to code follows five simple commandments:

|                                                  |                                                                |
|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1)** Be lazy!                                  | Desire for shortcuts motivates you to explore more!            |
| **2)** ~~Google~~ The Hive-Mind knows everything!| 99% of the time, someone else has already had the same issue.  |
| **3)** Document everything you do!               | Make future you happy!                                         |
| **4)** There will ALWAYS be a typo!              | Don't get disheartened, even best programmers make mistakes!   |
| **5)** Don't be afraid of you freedom!           | Explore! Try out things!                                       |

## Pro Tip
Remember: No one writes code that works first time, or without looking at StackOverflow sooner or later.

### What is a terminal?

A terminal is simply a fancy window that allows you to access the command-line
interface of a computer or server.

The command-line itself is how you can work on the computer with just text.

`bash` (**b**ourne **a**gain **sh**ell) is one of the most popular languages
used in the
terminal.

### Understanding the command prompt

![An example command prompt](assets/images/chapters/bare-bones-bash/Command_line_screenshot.png)

After opening the terminal what you will normally see is a blank screen with a
'command prompt', like the one shown above. This typically consists of your
username, the device name, a colon, a directory path and ends with a dollar
symbol. Like so:

```bash
<username>@<device_name>:~$
```

The commmand prompt is **never** involved in any command, it is just there
to ensure you know who and where you are. When copying a 
command you should **NOT** copy the command prompt.

Often times, when looking for commands online, the commands ran will pe prefaced
with a `$`. This is a stand-in for the command prompt. When adding multi-line
commands, it is also common to preface the additional lines with a `>`. When
copying such commands it is therefore important to remove these characters from
the start of each line (if present).

Finally, in this tutorial, the symbols`<>` are used to show things that
will/should be replaced by another value. For example, in Thiseas' command
prompt `<username>` will be replaced by `lamnidis`, as that is his username.

Now back to your prompt: It tells you that you are in the directory `~`.
The directory `~`, stands for your **home** directory. Note that this shorthand 
will point to a different place, depending on the machine and the user.

If you want to know what the shorthand means, (here comes your first command!)
you can type in `pwd`, which stands for "**p**rint **w**orking **d**irectory". 
Your "working directory" is whichever directory you are currently in. 

```bash
pwd
```

```
/home/ubuntu
```

This prints the entire "filepath" of the directory i.e. the route from the
"root" (the deepest directory of the machine), through every subdirectory,
leading to your particular working directory. 

### Absolute vs Relavtive paths

There are two types of filepaths: 

* An **absolute** path will start with the deepest directory in the machine
  shown as a `/`. Paths starting with `~` are also absolute paths, since `~` 
  translates to an absolute path of your specific home directory. That is the 
  directory path you see in the output of the `pwd` command you just ran.
* Alternatively a **relative** path always begins from your working directory
  (i.e.   your current directory). Often this type of path will begin with one
  (`./`) or two (`../`) dots followed by a forward slash, **but not always**. In
  the syntax of relative pathways `.` means "the current directory" and `..` 
  means "the parent directory" (or the 'one above'). 

#### A real life analogy for paths

You have just arrived to Leipzig for a summer school that is taking place at
MPI-EVA. After some questionable navigation, you find yourself at the Bayerische
Bahnhof. Tired and disheartened, you decide to ask for help.

You see a friendly-looking metalhead, and decide to ask them for directions!

![A friendly-looking metalhead.](assets/images/chapters/bare-bones-bash/bbb_james.png){width=20% fig-align="center"}

> Happy to help, but I only give directions in **absolute paths!**  
From Leipzig Main Station, you should take Querstraße southward.  
Continue straight and take Nürnberger Str. southward until you reach Str. des
18 Oktober.  
Finally take Str. des 18 Oktober. moving southeast until you reach MPI-EVA!

:::{.callout-tip}
## Absolute paths
The directions above are equivalent to an absolute path, because they will
ALWAYS take you to MPI-EVA, but you can only apply these directions **if** you
start from Leipzig Main Station!

Examples of absolute paths:  
`/home/ubuntu`  
`/Leipzig_Main_Station/Querstraße/Nürnberger_Str/Str_18_Oktober/Deutscher_Platz/MPI-EVA`  
:::

Not sure how to get back to Leipzig Main Station to apply those directions, you decide to
ask someone else for directions...

Lucky for you, a friendly looking local is passing by!

![A friendly-looking local.](assets/images/chapters/bare-bones-bash/bbb_aida.png){width=20% fig-align="center"}

> You're currently on Str. des 18 Oktober. Walk straight that way, past the tram tracks, and you will find Deutscher Platz. You will see MPI-EVA to your right!

:::{.callout-tip}
## Relative paths
These directions are equivalent to a relative path! They are easy to follow, but only work when you happen to start at the position you were in when you first got the directions!

Examples of relative paths:  
`./my_directory/my_file.txt`  
`../Str_18_Oktober/Deutscher_Platz/MPI-EVA`

### Basic commands
We will now explore some basic commands that you will use to explore folders and interact with files:

- **l**i**s**t directory contents:
```bash
ls
```
Output should look like:
```
Desktop    Downloads  Pictures  Templates  bin    snap
Documents  Music      Public    Videos     cache  thinclient_drives
```

::: {.callout-note}
We will use this format to show you commands and their corresponding output in the terminal (if any) for the rest of this chapter.
:::

- **m**a**k**e a **dir**ectory:
```bash
mkdir barebonesbash
```

- **m**o**v**e (or rename) files and directories
```bash
mv barebonesbash BareBonesBash
```

- **c**hange **d**irectories
```bash
cd BareBonesBash
```

- Download (**w**ww **get**) a remote file to your computer
```bash
wget git.io/Boosted-BBB-meta
```

- **c**o**p**y a file or directory to a new location
```bash
cp Boosted-BBB-meta Boosted-BBB-meta.tsv
```

- **r**e**m**ove (delete) files
```bash
rm Boosted-BBB-meta
```

- Con**cat**enate file contents to screen
```bash
cat Boosted-BBB-meta.tsv
```

- See only the **first**/**last** 10 lines of a file
```bash
head -n 10 Boosted-BBB-meta.tsv
tail -n 10 Boosted-BBB-meta.tsv
```
::: {.callout-note}
This is because the start of a cat is its head and the end of the cat is its tail (The great humor of computer scientists)
:::


- Look at the contents of a file interactively (**less** than the complete file, press `q` to quit)
```bash
less Boosted-BBB-meta.tsv
```

- **w**ord **c**ount the number of **l**ines (-l) in a file
```bash
wc -l Boosted-BBB-meta.tsv
```

### Datastreams, piping, and redirects

#### Datastreams

Computer programs can take in and spit out data from different _streams_. By
default there are 3 such data streams.

- `stdin` : the **st**an**d**ard **in**put
- `stdout`: the **st**an**d**ard **out**put
- `stderr`: the **st**an**d**ard **err**or

![](assets/images/chapters/bare-bones-bash/Datastreams.png){width=80% fig-align="center"}

:::{.callout-tip}
## Pro Tip
Each programme also has an 'exit code', which can tell you if execution
completed with/without errors. You will rarely see these in the wild.
:::

Typically, the `stdin` is where the input data comes in.  
The `stdout` is the actual output of the command. In some cases this gets
printed to the screen, but most often this is the information that needs to be
saved in an output file.  
The `stderr` is the datastream where errors and warnings go. This gets printed
to your terminal to let you know when something is not going according to plan!

<!-- TODO maybe add a picture of a command that prints both output and error? -->

#### Piping

A "pipe" (`|`) is a really useful feature of `bash` that lets you chain together
multiple commands! When two commands are chained together with a pipe, the
`stdout` of the first command becomes the `stdin` of the second!
The `stderr` is still printed on your screen, so you can always know when things
fail.

![](assets/images/chapters/bare-bones-bash/Piping.png){width=80% fig-align="center"}

Example:
```bash
head -n 10 Boosted-BBB-meta.tsv | tail -n1
```

```
netsukeJapan    C       Artwork
```

The above command will only show the 10th line of `Boosted-BBB-meta.tsv`.
The way it works is that `head` will take the first 10 lines of the file. These
lines are then passed on to `tail` which will keep only the last of those lines.

#### Redirects

Much like streams of water in the real world, datastreams can be redirected.

This way you can save the stdout of a program (or even the stderr) into a file for later!


- `stdin` can be redirected with `<`.
    - An arrow pointing TO your program name!
- `stdout` can be redirected with `>`.
    - An arrow pointing AWAY your program name!
- `stderr` can be redirected with `2>`.
    - Because it is the secondary output stream.

:::{.callout-tip}
## Pro Tip
It is also possible to combine streams, but we won't get into that here.
:::

Example:
```bash
head -n 10 Boosted-BBB-meta.tsv | tail -n1 > line10.txt
```

This will create a new file called `line10.txt` within your work directory.
Using `cat` on this file will BLOW YOUR MIND - (GONE WRONG)!

```bash
cat line10.txt
```

```
netsukeJapan    C       Artwork
```

### Helptext

You don't always have to google for documentation! Many programs come with in-built helptext,
or access to online manuals right from your terminal!

- You can get a __one sentence summary__ of what a tool does with `whatis`

```bash
whatis cat
```

```
cat(1)  - concatenate files and print on the standard 
          output
```

- While `man` gives you __access to online manuals__ for each tool (exit with `q`)
```bash
man cat
```

### Variables

A variable is a named container whose contents you can expand at will or change.

You can assign variables (tell the computer what do you want it to contain) with `=` and pull their contents with `$`

The easiest way to see the contents of a varable is using `echo`!
```bash
echo "This is my home directory: $HOME"
```
```
This is my home directory: /home/ubuntu
```

`$HOME` is a varible of the type called **environment variables**, which are set the moment you open your terminal or log into a server, they ensure the system works as intended and should not be change unless you are **very** sure of why. 

But as mentioned, you can store in a variable anything you want, so let's see a few examples:

First let's try to store a number:

```bash
GreekFood=4            #Here, 'GreekFood' is a number.
echo "Greek food is $GreekFood people who want to know what heaven tastes like."
```
```
Greek food is 4 people who want to know what heaven tastes like.
```
::: {.callout-note}
The `#` is used to add comments to your code. Comments are annotations that you write in your code to understand what it is doing but that the computer does not run. Very useful for when your future self or another person looks at your code
:::


Now let's store a word ('string'):

```bash
GreekFood=delicious   #We overwrite that number with a word (i.e. a 'string').
echo "Everyone says that Greek food is $GreekFood."
```

```
Everyone says that Greek food is delicious.
```

You can also store more than a single word:

```bash
GreekFood="Greek wine" #We can overwrite 'GreekFood' again, 
## but when there is a space in our string, we need quotations.
echo "The only thing better than Greek food is $GreekFood!"
```

```
The only thing better than Greek food is Greek wine!
```

Since can be reset variables to whatever you want, you can also store a number again:

```bash
GreekFood=7 #And, of course, we can overwrite with a number again too.
echo "I have been to Greece $GreekFood times already this year, for the food and wine!"
```

```
I have been to Greece 7 times already this year, for the food and wine!
```

::: {.callout-warning}
In this examples you have seen how the same variable has been overwritten, this means that you can only access the last content that you stored in the variable. All the previous contents that a variable may have had are innaccessible as soon as the same variable is given a new value.
:::

### Quotes matter!
In bash, there is a big difference between a single quote `'` and a double quote `"`!

 - The contents of single quotes, are passed on as they are.
 - Inside double quotes, contents are _interpreted_!

In some cases the difference doesn't matter:

```bash
echo "I like Greek Food"
echo 'I like Greek Food'
```
```
I like Greek Food
I like Greek Food
```

In other cases it makes all the difference:

```bash
Arr=Banana
echo 'Pirates say $Arr'
echo "Minions say $Arr"
```
```
Pirates say $Arr
Minions say Banana
```

**Why does it make a difference in the second example?** 

This is because in the second example we are using a variable. We have assigned `Banana` to the variable `$Arr`. As mentioned above, when single (`'`) quotes are used the computer just prints what it receives without caring that `$Arr` is a varible.

 In the `echo` with the double (`"`) quotes we are telling the computer to extract the value from the variable `$Arr` and that is why we see the store value (`Banana`) in the printed output in the terminal.

### Find

You can also ask your computer where you have put your files, in case you forgot. To do this you can use **find**! 
The **find** command has the following syntax:

```bash
find /your/folder/ -type f -name 'your_file.txt'
```

- **First** part of the `find` command: *the place to look from*
  - e.g. `.` to indicate 'here'
  - Could also use `~/`
  - Could use absolute path e.g. `/home/james/`

- **Second** part of the `find` command: *what type of things to look for?*
  - Use `-type` to define the filetype:
     - **f**ile
     - **d**irectory

- **Third** part of the `find` command: *what to look in?*
  - Use `-name` to say 'look in **names** of things'

- **Finally** after `-name` we give the the 'strings' to search for
  - Use wildcards (`*`) for maximum laziness!


Now let's put into practise what you have learnt about `find`. 

For that you will download a messy folder from a collaborator, remember to check you are in the BareBonesBash folder!:

```bash
wget git.io/Boosted-BBB-images -O Boosted-BBB.zip
```

We realise that this is a compressed file, and more precisely is a zip file (extension `.zip`). In order to access to its content we will need to "unzip" it first. For that we can use the command **unzip**: 

```bash
unzip Boosted-BBB.zip
```
We know that our collaborator has shared with us some pictures from animals that we need to use for our research, and according to your collaborator they are marked with `JPG`. We first try to check the contents of the directory to find them quickly.

```bash
ls Boosted-BBB
```
```
And		Digging		Friday		Leave		Only		Where		Young
Anybody		Everything	Getting		Looking		Ooh		With		Youre
Dancing		Feel		Having		Night		Watch		You
```

Wow, what a mess! How would you retrieve all the files?
Thanks to your wonderful teachers you have learnt how to use find and can simply run:

```bash
find Boosted-BBB -type f -name '*JPG*' 
```
```

Boosted-BBB/Night/is/young/and/the/musics/high/bydgoszczForest.JPG.MP3.TXT
Boosted-BBB/Ooh/see/that/girl/pompeii.JPG.MP3.TXT
```

After `-name` we have written `'*JPG*'`, this tells to `find` to search for any file that contains `JPG` in any part of its name, indicated by the `*`. The `*` are what are known as wildcards (To learn more on how to use them, please refer to the more complete material for this [tutorial](https://barebonesbash.github.io/#/)).  

Now you have all the paths of the files that you will need!

### For loops

Until now we have seen how to run single commands on a file. But, what about when you need to **repeat** a command multiple times on a list of things, for example a list of files? 

To repeat an action (command) for a set of things (list, e.g. files) one needs to employ the concept of a loop. One of the most commonly used loops, is the **for** loop.

A **for** loop allows us to go through a list of things and perform some actions. Let's see an example:

```bash
Variable=Yes
for i in Greece Spain Britain; do
  echo "Does $i have lovely food? $Variable"
done
```

```
Does Greece have lovely food? Yes
Does Spain have lovely food? Yes
Does Britain have lovely food? Yes
```

The for loop went through the list `Greece Spain Britain` and printed a statement with each item in the list. What happens if we change the order of the list to `Britain Greece Spain`?

```bash
Variable=Yes
for i in Britain Greece Spain; do
  echo "Does $i have lovely food? $Variable"
Thank done
```

```
Does Britain have lovely food? Yes
Does Greece have lovely food? Yes
Does Spain have lovely food? Yes
```
We see that changing the order of the list will affect the output, this is because the **for** loop will go through the list in a sequencial manner. 

We can also add more elements to the list, and the **for** loop will continue until it reaches the end of the list.

### How to Google like a pro

> Only when you know the question will you know what the answer means.

- ALWAYS include the name of the language in your query.
  - **BAD:**  "How to cat"
  - **GOOD:** "How to cat bash"

- BROADEN your question!
  - **BAD:** "How to set **X** to **4** in bash?"
  - **GOOD:** "How to set a **variable** to an **integer** in bash?"
<br>
- When you are more familiar, use fancy programmer lingo to make google think
you know what you are talking about.

**Note:** some of these terms can be language specific.
:::

### (optional) Cleanup

It is extremely important to ALWAYS keep your directories clean from random
clutter. This lowers the chances you will get lost in your  directories, but
also ensures you can stay lazy, since TAB completion will not keep finding
similarly named files. So let's clean up your home directory by removing all
the clutter we downloaded and worked with today. The command below will remove
the `~/BareBonesBash` directory **as well as all of its contents**. 

```bash
cd ~     ## We shouldn't delete a directory while we are still in it. (It is possible though).
rm -r ~/BareBonesBash
```

:::{.callout-tip}
## Pro Tip
Always be VERY careful when using `rm -r`. Check 3x that the path you are
specifying is exactly what you want to delete and nothing more before pressing
ENTER!
:::

### Conclusion

You should now know the basics of working on the command line, like:

* What a command prompt is
* How to navigate around the filesystem via the command line
* How to view the contents of a file
* How to remove files and directories
* What a datastream is, and how they can be redirected
* How to chain commands together
