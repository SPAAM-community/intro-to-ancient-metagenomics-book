               change. In particular, the study of microbial ancient DNA
               preserved in sediment archives from lakes and oceans can help us
               to evaluate the responses of aquatic microbes in the past and
               make predictions about future biodiversity change in those
               ecosystems. Recent advances in molecular genetic methods applied
               to the analysis of historically deposited DNA in sediments have
               not only allowed the taxonomic identification of past aquatic
               microbial communities but also enabled tracing their evolution
               and adaptation to episodic disturbances and gradual environmental
               change. Nevertheless, some challenges remain for scientists to
               take full advantage of the rapidly developing field of
               paleo-genetics, including the limited ability to detect rare taxa

               challenges related to the application of molecular genetic
               methods to study microbial diversity, ecology, and evolution in

               historically relied on morphological identification of macro- and
               microfossils from sediments of small freshwater lakes. Here, we
               report new protocols that reliably yield DNA sequence data from
               Holocene plant macrofossils and bulk lake sediment used to infer
               ecological change. This will allow changes in census populations,
               estimated from fossils and associated sediment, to be directly
               associated with population genetic changes. RESULTS: We
               successfully sequenced DNA from 64 samples (out of 126) comprised
               of bulk sediment and seeds, leaf fragments, budscales, and
               samaras extracted from Holocene lake sediments in the western
               Great Lakes region of North America. Overall, DNA yields were
               low. However, we were able to reliably amplify samples with as
               few as 10 copies of a short cpDNA fragment with little detectable
               PCR inhibition. Our success rate was highest for sediments < 2000
               years old, but we were able to successfully amplify DNA from
               samples up to 4600 years old. DNA sequences matched the taxonomic
               identity of the macrofossil from which they were extracted 79\%
               of the time. Exceptions suggest that DNA molecules from
               surrounding nearby sediments may permeate or adhere to
               macrofossils in sediments. CONCLUSIONS: An ability to extract
               ancient DNA from Holocene sediments potentially allows exciting
               new insights into the genetic consequences of long-term
               environmental change. The low DNA copy numbers we found in fossil
               material and the discovery of multiple sequence variants from
               single macrofossil extractions highlight the need for careful
               experimental and laboratory protocols. Further application of
               these protocols should lead to better understanding of the
               ecological and evolutionary consequences of environmental change.},

               years ago1 had climates resembling those forecasted under future
               warming2. Palaeoclimatic records show strong polar amplification
               with mean annual temperatures of 11-19 °C above contemporary
               values3,4. The biological communities inhabiting the Arctic
               during this time remain poorly known because fossils are rare5.
               Here we report an ancient environmental DNA6 (eDNA) record
               describing the rich plant and animal assemblages of the Kap
               København Formation in North Greenland, dated to around two
               million years ago. The record shows an open boreal forest
               ecosystem with mixed vegetation of poplar, birch and thuja trees,
               as well as a variety of Arctic and boreal shrubs and herbs, many
               of which had not previously been detected at the site from
               macrofossil and pollen records. The DNA record confirms the
               presence of hare and mitochondrial DNA from animals including
               mastodons, reindeer, rodents and geese, all ancestral to their
               present-day and late Pleistocene relatives. The presence of
               marine species including horseshoe crab and green algae support a
               warmer climate than today. The reconstructed ecosystem has no
               modern analogue. The survival of such ancient eDNA probably
               relates to its binding to mineral surfaces. Our findings open new
               areas of genetic research, demonstrating that it is possible to
               track the ecology and evolution of biological communities from
               two million years ago using ancient eDNA.},

               organic matter and are ubiquitous in most environments. Such DNA
               becomes fragmented and damaged (often <100 bp) and may persist in
               the environment for more than half a million years. Fragmented
               DNA is recognized as nutrient source for microbes, but not as
               potential substrate for bacterial evolution. Here, we show that
               fragmented DNA molecules (≥ 20 bp) that additionally may contain
               abasic sites, cross-links, or miscoding lesions are acquired by
               the environmental bacterium Acinetobacter baylyi through natural
               transformation. With uptake of DNA from a 43,000-y-old woolly
               mammoth bone, we further demonstrate that such natural
               transformation events include ancient DNA molecules. We find that
               the DNA recombination is RecA recombinase independent and is
               directly linked to DNA replication. We show that the adjacent

               appear more common among genomes of transformable than
               nontransformable bacteria. Our findings reveal that short and
               damaged, including truly ancient, DNA molecules, which are
               present in large quantities in the environment, can be acquired
               by bacteria through natural transformation. Our findings open for

               at archaeological sites. PalEnDNA analysis provides a relatively
               new tool for Quaternary and archaeological sciences and its
               applications have included palaeoenvironmental and palaeodietary

               extinctions, human–environment interactions, taxonomic studies,
               and studies of DNA damage. Because PalEnDNA samples comprise
               markedly different materials, and represent wide‐ranging
               depositional and taphonomic contexts, various issues must be
               addressed to achieve robust, reproducible findings. Such issues

              resource for the study of past hominin and environmental
              diversity. However, little is known about how DNA is preserved in
              sediments and the extent to which it may be translocated between
              archaeological strata. Here, we investigate DNA preservation in 47
              blocks of resin-impregnated archaeological sediment collected over
              the last four decades for micromorphological analyses at 13
              prehistoric sites in Europe, Asia, Africa, and North America and
              show that such blocks can preserve DNA of hominins and other
              mammals. Extensive microsampling of sediment blocks from Denisova
              Cave in the Altai Mountains reveals that the taxonomic composition
              of mammalian DNA differs drastically at the millimeter-scale and
              that DNA is concentrated in small particles, especially in
              fragments of bone and feces (coprolites), suggesting that these
              are substantial sources of DNA in sediments. Three microsamples
              taken in close proximity in one of the blocks yielded Neanderthal
              DNA from at least two male individuals closely related to Denisova
              5, a Neanderthal toe bone previously recovered from the same
              layer. Our work indicates that DNA can remain stably localized in
              sediments over time and provides a means of linking genetic

              extraction of ancient DNA (aDNA) from both frozen and nonfrozen
              sediments (even in the absence of macrofossils) in order to obtain
              genetic ``profiles'' from past environments. One of the hazards
              associated with this approach, particularly in nonfrozen
              environments, is the potential for vertical migration of aDNA
              across strata. To assess the extent of this problem, we extracted
              aDNA from sediments up to 3300 years old at 2 cave sites in the
              North Island of New Zealand. These sites are ideal for this
              purpose as the presence or absence of DNA from nonindigenous fauna
              (such as sheep) in sediments deposited prior to European
              settlement can serve as an indicator of DNA movement.
              Additionally, these strata are well defined and dated. DNA from
              sheep was found in strata that also contained moa DNA, indicating
              that genetic material had migrated downwards. Quantitative
              polymerase chain reaction analyses demonstrated that the amount of
              sheep DNA decreased as the age of sediments increased. Our results
              suggest that sedimentary aDNA is unlikely to be deposited from
              wind-borne DNA and that physical remains of organisms or their

               quagga were genetically studied in 1984 (Pääbo 1984; Higuchi et
               al. 1984). While multiple palaeoecological proxies exist for
               assessing the presence of plants, fungi, and microorganisms
               through time, studying Quaternary macro-fauna and humans has been
               based predominantly on visible remains like bones, teeth, and
               human-made artifacts. Although these provide the most direct
               measures of past animal presence, numerous taphonomic processes
               will transform and recycle these relatively rare materials over
               time, resulting in only a tiny fraction of past organisms being
               represented in macro-fossil records today. The key benefit of
               environmental DNA (eDNA) in this regard is that it is a
               continuously disseminated and high abundance micro-indicator that
               can be used to study the shifting presence of animal species
               through time, co-occurrences with other species, evolutionary
               histories through genome reassembly and phylogenetics, and even
               estimate how long ago these animals lived based solely on the
               accumulation of genetic mutations relative to other individuals
               of known ages. All these applications (and more) are already

               the fundamentals of the DNA–sediment associations in

               Palaeoecological studies using sedimentary ancient DNA (sedDNA)
               offer unique advantages over conventional pollen and macrofossil
               methods due to higher taxonomic resolution and better detection
               of insect pollinated taxa than pollen, and higher detectability
               than macrofossil. Like macrofossils, sedDNA is mainly deposited
               within the catchment and thus provide a more geographically
               constrained catchment area than pollen. To ensure accurate
               reconstructions, it is vital to comprehend DNA preservation and
               degradation processes in sediments. Molecular ecology techniques
               like metabarcoding, shotgun sequencing, and capture probe methods
               have revolutionized the detection of floral diversity through
               sedDNA analysis. These methods enhance our ability to identify
               plant species and lineages with remarkable precision, enriching
               our understanding of past vegetation dynamics. However, it is
               essential to acknowledge potential biases in sedDNA methods when
               reconstructing past floral compositions. Factors such as DNA
               preservation, incomplete reference databases, and amplification
               biases must be considered to avoid misinterpretation. The
               applications of sedDNA extend to various ecological inquiries,
               including reconstructing past vegetation dynamics, studying plant
               dispersal and establishment, and investigating Arctic and Alpine
               ecosystem responses to environmental change. Moreover, sedDNA can
               trace single species and explore genetic adaptations over time.
               Sedimentary DNA analysis also holds promise in detecting human
               impact on vegetation and domesticated taxa, offering valuable
               insights into the past influence of human activities on plant
               communities. Future directions in sedDNA research involve method
               refinement, broadening regional applications, and integrating
               sedDNA data with other paleoecological proxies. This approach
               allows us to continue utilizing sedDNA’s potential to unveil the
               complex history of plant communities and their responses to

               marine water columns, and sediments themselves, thereby acting as
               an archive of genetic information which can be used to
               reconstruct past changes in source environments. In this review,
               we identify and discuss DNA pools in marine sediments, with
               special focus on DNA not enclosed in living cells, its origin,
               dynamics, and ecological and methodological implications.
               Achievements in deciphering the genetic information held within
               each DNA pool are presented along with still-standing challenges
               and major gaps in current knowledge.",

               occurred within 2 h. The amounts of DNA which adsorbed to sand
               increased with the salt concentration (0.1 to 4 M NaCl and 1 mM
               to 0.2 M MgCl2), salt valency (Na+ less than Mg2+ and Ca2+), and
               pH (5 to 9). Maximum desorption of DNA from sand (43 to 59\%) was
               achieved when columns were eluted with NaPO4 and NaCl for 6 h or
               with EDTA for 1 h. DNA did not desorb in the presence of
               detergents. It is concluded that adsorption proceeded by physical
               and chemical (Mg2+ bridging) interaction between the DNA and sand
               surfaces. Degradability by DNase I decreased upon adsorption of

               MgCl2, the degradation rate was higher than when it adsorbed in

               complexes with different accessibilities of adsorbed DNA to DNase
               I existed. The degradability of DNA adsorbed to minor mineral

              Tasmania, in 2018. These seven methods contrasted frozen versus

              ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) incubation, DNA binding in

               animal sedaDNA in 2003 (Hofreiter et al. 2003; Willerslev et al.
               2003). Since then, it has been shown that sedaDNA can be
               recovered at high resolution from recent (101–102 year-old)
               (e.g., Capo et al. 2017) through to deep-time (105–106 year-old)

               binding, facilitating long-term biomolecular preservation, but
               also challenging DNA isolation. Two common limitations in sedaDNA
               extraction are the carryover of other substances that inhibit

              challenges. Existing approaches address some issues, but are
              mostly limited to metabarcoding or optimized for microbial data.
              We present PIA (Phylogenetic Intersection Analysis): a taxonomic
              binner that works from standard BLAST output while mitigating key
              effects of incomplete databases. Benchmarking against MEGAN using
              sedaDNA suggests that, while PIA is less sensitive, it can be more
              accurate. We use known sequences to estimate the accuracy of PIA
              at up to 96\% when the real organism is not represented in the
              database. For ancient DNA, where taxa of interest are frequently
              over-represented domesticates or absent, poorly-known organisms,
              more accurate assignment is critical, even at the expense of
              sensitivity. PIA offers an approach to objectively filter out
              false positive hits without the need to manually remove taxa and
              so make presuppositions about past environments and their
              palaeoecologies.",

               based on sedimentary DNA (sedDNA) retrieved from diverse inland
               aquatic ecosystems, provided that certain variable environmental
               factors are taken into consideration in order to trace the
               admixture of prokaryotic sedDNA preserved in lacustrine sediments
               from source to sink. These include several watershed
               characteristics, such as climate and mineralogy in the catchment
               and degree of urbanization, which in turn determine the lake
               regime, productivity and geochemistry of the water body, redox
               conditions at the sediment-water interface, sedimentation rates
               and organic matter content over time.Records of environmental
               conditions through the preservation of prokaryotic sedDNA will
               partially be obscured by the presence of a subsurface biosphere
               that remains active during burial. Sediment colonization and
               selective growth of specific sub-populations of the resident
               microbiomes are inherent to the substrates available in
               lacustrine deposits. Microbial guilds reflective of respiration
               types and organic matter decomposition usually go hand-in-hand
               with the geochemical gradient that develops in the sedimentary
               column during early diagenetic processes, but may also prevail in
               specific stratigraphic intervals. Thus, the correct attribution
               of prokaryotic sedDNA sources to an environmental context is
               essential for resolving past and modern ecosystem functioning.
               Because the succession of microbial taxa pre-adapted to gradual
               depletion of electron donors and acceptors is relatively well
               known, sources of sedDNA inherent to resident microbial
               communities can be discriminated and provide evidence of
               diagenetic processes during burial. In contrast, ancient sources
               of sedDNA that persist in microbially active sediments are
               exposed to a constant turnover, leading to preferential
               preservation of dormant stages over free sedDNA.Bacteria and
               archaea are tremendously diverse, and therefore there is the need
               to rigorously assign their metabolic functions and assess their
               degree of activity along sediment archives. Beyond taxonomic
               surveys and geochemical profiling of the subsurface biosphere,
               novel procedures are being customized to sort, target, sequence
               and assemble sedDNA fragments of interest to unravel specific
               biogeochemical interactions in lacustrine ecosystems pertaining
               past and actual ecological changes at the local and global scale.",

               northern Russia and contribute important ecosystem services to
               the world. It is important to understand the past dynamics of
               larches in order to predict their likely response to a changing
               climate in the future. Sedimentary ancient DNA extracted from
               lake sediment cores can serve as archives to study past
               vegetation. However, the traditional method of studying
               sedimentary ancient DNA-metabarcoding-focuses on small fragments,
               which cannot resolve Larix to species level nor allow a detailed
               study of population dynamics. Here, we use shotgun sequencing and
               hybridization capture with long-range PCR-generated baits
               covering the complete Larix chloroplast genome to study Larix
               populations from a sediment core reaching back to 6700 years from
               the Taymyr region in northern Siberia. In comparison with shotgun
               sequencing, hybridization capture results in an increase in
               taxonomically classified reads by several orders of magnitude and
               the recovery of complete chloroplast genomes of Larix. Variation
               in the chloroplast reads corroborates an invasion of Larix
               gmelinii into the range of Larix sibirica before 6700 years ago.
               Since then, both species have been present at the site, although
               larch populations have decreased with only a few trees remaining
               in what was once a forested area. This study demonstrates for the
               first time that hybridization capture applied directly to ancient
               DNA of plants extracted from lake sediments can provide
               genome-scale information and is a viable tool for studying past
               genomic changes in populations of single species, irrespective of
               a preservation as macrofossil.",
