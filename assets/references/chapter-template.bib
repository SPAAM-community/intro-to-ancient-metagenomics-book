  abstract = {Ancient DNA and RNA are valuable data sources for a wide range of
              disciplines. Within the field of ancient metagenomics, the number
              of published genetic datasets has risen dramatically in recent
              years, and tracking this data for reuse is particularly important
              for large-scale ecological and evolutionary studies of individual
              taxa and communities of both microbes and eukaryotes.
              AncientMetagenomeDir (archived at
              https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3980833 ) is a collection of
              annotated metagenomic sample lists derived from published studies
              that provide basic, standardised metadata and accession numbers to
              allow rapid data retrieval from online repositories. These tables
              are community-curated and span multiple sub-disciplines to ensure
              adequate breadth and consensus in metadata definitions, as well as
              longevity of the database. Internal guidelines and automated
              checks facilitate compatibility with established sequence-read
              archives and term-ontologies, and ensure consistency and
              interoperability for future meta-analyses. This collection will
              also assist in standardising metadata reporting for future ancient
              metagenomic studies.},
