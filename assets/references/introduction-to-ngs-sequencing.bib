              detecting low-frequency genetic variants that are important for
              cancer molecular diagnosis, treatment, and surveillance using deep
              next-generation sequencing (NGS). However, there is a lack of
              comprehensive understanding of errors introduced at various steps
              of a conventional NGS workflow, such as sample handling, library
              preparation, PCR enrichment, and sequencing. In this study, we use
              current NGS technology to systematically investigate these
              questions. RESULTS: By evaluating read-specific error
              distributions, we discover that the substitution error rate can be
              computationally suppressed to 10-5 to 10-4, which is 10- to
              100-fold lower than generally considered achievable (10-3) in the
              current literature. We then quantify substitution errors
              attributable to sample handling, library preparation, enrichment
              PCR, and sequencing by using multiple deep sequencing datasets. We
              find that error rates differ by nucleotide substitution types,
              ranging from 10-5 for A>C/T>G, C>A/G>T, and C>G/G>C changes to
              10-4 for A>G/T>C changes. Furthermore, C>T/G>A errors exhibit
              strong sequence context dependency, sample-specific effects
              dominate elevated C>A/G>T errors, and target-enrichment PCR led to
              ~ 6-fold increase of overall error rate. We also find that more
              than 70\% of hotspot variants can be detected at 0.1 ~ 0.01\%
              frequency with the current NGS technology by applying in silico
              error suppression. CONCLUSIONS: We present the first comprehensive
              analysis of sequencing error sources in conventional NGS
              workflows. The error profiles revealed by our study highlight new
              directions for further improving NGS analysis accuracy both

              biomedical discovery through its ability to generate thousands of
              gigabases of sequencing output per run at a fraction of the time
              and cost of conventional technologies. The process typically
              involves four basic steps: library preparation, cluster
              generation, sequencing, and data analysis. In 2015, a new
              chemistry of cluster generation was introduced in the newer
              Illumina machines (HiSeq 3000/4000/X Ten) called exclusion
              amplification (ExAmp), which was a fundamental shift from the
              earlier method of random cluster generation by bridge
              amplification on a non-patterned flow cell. The ExAmp chemistry,
              in conjunction with patterned flow cells containing nanowells at
              fixed locations, increases cluster density on the flow cell,
              thereby reducing the cost per run. It also increases sequence read
              quality, especially for longer read lengths (up to 150 base
              pairs). This advance has been widely adopted for genome sequencing
              because greater sequencing depth can be achieved for lower cost
              without compromising the quality of longer reads. We show that
              this promising chemistry is problematic, however, when
              multiplexing samples. We discovered that up to 5-10\% of
              sequencing reads (or signals) are incorrectly assigned from a
              given sample to other samples in a multiplexed pool. We provide
              evidence that this “spreading-of-signals” arises from low levels
              of free index primers present in the pool. These index primers can
              prime pooled library fragments at random via complementary 3′
              ends, and get extended by DNA polymerase, creating a new library
              molecule with a new index before binding to the patterned flow
              cell to generate a cluster for sequencing. This causes the
              resulting read from that cluster to be assigned to a different
              sample, causing the spread of signals within multiplexed samples.
              We show that low levels of free index primers persist after the
              most common library purification procedure recommended by
              Illumina, and that the amount of signal spreading among samples is
              proportional to the level of free index primer present in the
              library pool. This artifact causes homogenization and
              misclassification of cells in single cell RNA-seq experiments.
              Therefore, all data generated in this way must now be carefully
              re-examined to ensure that “spreading-of-signals” has not
              compromised data analysis and conclusions. Re-sequencing samples
              using an older technology that uses conventional bridge
              amplification for cluster generation, or improved library cleanup
              strategies to remove free index primers, can minimize or eliminate
              this signal spreading artifact.},

              encouraged wide use of sample multiplexing. However, this practice
              results in read misassignment (usually <1\%) across samples
              sequenced on the same lane. Alarmingly high rates of read
              misassignment of up to 10\% were reported for lllumina sequencing
              machines with exclusion amplification chemistry. This may make use
              of these platforms prohibitive, particularly in studies that rely
              on low-quantity and low-quality samples, such as historical and
              archaeological specimens. Here, we use barcodes, short sequences
              that are ligated to both ends of the DNA insert, to directly
              quantify the rate of index hopping in 100-year old
              museum-preserved gorilla (Gorilla beringei) samples. Correcting
              for multiple sources of noise, we identify on average 0.470\% of

              quantity of misassigned reads depends on the number of reads that
              any given sample contributes to the total sequencing pool, so that
              samples with few sequenced reads receive the greatest proportion
              of misassigned reads. This particularly affects ancient DNA
              samples, as these frequently differ in their DNA quantity and
              endogenous content. Through simulations we show that even low

              using molecular engineering approaches. In this approach, four
              nucleotides (A, C, G, T) are modified as reversible terminators by

              removed simultaneously in 30 s by Pd-catalyzed deallylation in
              aqueous buffer solution. This one-step dual-deallylation reaction
              thus allows the reinitiation of the polymerase reaction and
              increases the SBS efficiency. DNA templates consisting of
              homopolymer regions were accurately sequenced by using this class
              of fluorescent nucleotide analogues on a DNA chip and a four-color
              fluorescent scanner.},

  abstract = {Determining the order of nucleic acid residues in biological
              samples is an integral component of a wide variety of research
              applications. Over the last fifty years large numbers of
              researchers have applied themselves to the production of
              techniques and technologies to facilitate this feat, sequencing
              DNA and RNA molecules. This time-scale has witnessed tremendous
              changes, moving from sequencing short oligonucleotides to millions
              of bases, from struggling towards the deduction of the coding
              sequence of a single gene to rapid and widely available whole
              genome sequencing. This article traverses those years, iterating
              through the different generations of sequencing technology,
              highlighting some of the key discoveries, researchers, and
              sequences along the way.},

  abstract  = {DNA sequence information underpins genetic research, enabling
               discoveries of important biological or medical benefit.
               Sequencing projects have traditionally used long (400-800 base
               pair) reads, but the existence of reference sequences for the
               human and many other genomes makes it possible to develop new,
               fast approaches to re-sequencing, whereby shorter reads are
               compared to a reference to identify intraspecies genetic
               variation. Here we report an approach that generates several
               billion bases of accurate nucleotide sequence per experiment at
               low cost. Single molecules of DNA are attached to a flat surface,
               amplified in situ and used as templates for synthetic sequencing
               with fluorescent reversible terminator deoxyribonucleotides.
               Images of the surface are analysed to generate high-quality
               sequence. We demonstrate application of this approach to human
               genome sequencing on flow-sorted X chromosomes and then scale the
               approach to determine the genome sequence of a male Yoruba from
               Ibadan, Nigeria. We build an accurate consensus sequence from
               >30x average depth of paired 35-base reads. We characterize four
               million single-nucleotide polymorphisms and four hundred thousand
               structural variants, many of which were previously unknown. Our
               approach is effective for accurate, rapid and economical
               whole-genome re-sequencing and many other biomedical
               applications.},
