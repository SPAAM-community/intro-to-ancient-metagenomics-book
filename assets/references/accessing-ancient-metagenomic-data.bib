  abstract = {This study analyzes data sharing regarding mitochondrial, Y
              chromosomal and autosomal polymorphisms in a total of 162 papers
              on ancient human DNA published between 1988 and 2013. The
              estimated sharing rate was not far from totality (97.6\% ± 2.1\%)
              and substantially higher than observed in other fields of genetic
              research (evolutionary, medical and forensic genetics). Both a
              questionnaire-based survey and the examination of Journals'
              editorial policies suggest that this high sharing rate cannot be
              simply explained by the need to comply with stakeholders requests.
              Most data were made available through body text, but the use of
              primary databases increased in coincidence with the introduction
              of complete mitochondrial and next-generation sequencing methods.
              Our study highlights three important aspects. First, our results
              imply that researchers' awareness of the importance of openness
              and transparency for scientific progress may complement
              stakeholders' policies in achieving very high sharing rates.
              Second, widespread data sharing does not necessarily coincide with
              a prevalent use of practices which maximize data findability,
              accessibility, useability and preservation. A detailed look at the
              different ways in which data are released can be very useful to
              detect failures to adopt the best sharing modalities and
              understand how to correct them. Third and finally, the case of
              human paleogenetics tells us that a widespread awareness of the
              importance of Open Science may be important to build reliable
              scientific practices even in the presence of complex experimental
              challenges.},

              AncientMetagenomeDir (archived at

              allow rapid data retrieval from online repositories. These tables

              whole-genome resequencing. Starting with next-generation

              simulated ancient metagenomic samples, we benchmark aMeta against

  abstract  = {Background Access to sample-level metadata is important when
               selecting public metagenomic sequencing datasets for reuse in new
               biological analyses. The Standards, Precautions, and Advances in
               Ancient Metagenomics community (SPAAM,
               https://spaam-community.org) has previously published
               AncientMetagenomeDir, a collection of curated and standardised
               sample metadata tables for metagenomic and microbial genome
               datasets generated from ancient samples. However, while
               sample-level information is useful for identifying relevant
               samples for inclusion in new projects, Next Generation Sequencing
               (NGS) library construction and sequencing metadata are also
               essential for appropriately reprocessing ancient metagenomic
               data. Currently, recovering information for downloading and
               preparing such data is difficult when laboratory and
               bioinformatic metadata is heterogeneously recorded in prose-based
               publications. Methods Through a series of community-based
               hackathon events, AncientMetagenomeDir was updated to provide
               standardised library-level metadata of existing and new ancient
               metagenomic samples. In tandem, the companion tool 'AMDirT' was
               developed to facilitate rapid data filtering and downloading of
               ancient metagenomic data, as well as improving automated metadata
               curation and validation for AncientMetagenomeDir. Results
               AncientMetagenomeDir was extended to include standardised
               metadata of over 6000 ancient metagenomic libraries. The
               companion tool 'AMDirT' provides both graphical- and command-line
               interface based access to such metadata for users from a wide
               range of computational backgrounds. We also report on errors with
               metadata reporting that appear to commonly occur during data
               upload and provide suggestions on how to improve the quality of
               data sharing by the community. Conclusions Together, both
               standardised metadata reporting and tooling will help towards
               easier incorporation and reuse of public ancient metagenomic
               datasets into future analyses.},

               represents a unique archaeological finding for the prehistory of
               Southern Italy. The unusual placement of the inhumation at a
               rather high altitude and far from inhabited areas, the lack of
               funerary equipment and the prone deposition of the body find
               limited similarities in coeval Italian sites. These elements have
               prompted wider questions on mortuary customs during the
               prehistory of Southern Italy. This atypical case requires an
               interdisciplinary approach aimed to build an integrated
               bioarchaeological profile of the individual. The
               paleopathological investigation of the skeletal remains revealed
               the presence of numerous markers that could be associated with
               craft activities, suggesting possible interpretations of the
               individual's lifestyle. CT analyses, carried out on the maxillary
               bones, showed the presence of a peculiar type of dental wear, but
               also a good density of the bone matrix. Biomolecular and
               micromorphological analyses of dental calculus highlight the
               presence of a rich Neolithic-like oral microbiome, the
               composition of which is consistent with the presence pathologies.
               Finally, paleogenomic data obtained from the individual were
               compared with ancient and modern Mediterranean populations,
               including unpublished high-resolution genome-wide data for 20
               modern inhabitants of the nearby village of San Lorenzo Bellizzi,
               which provided interesting insights into the biodemographic
               landscape of the Neolithic in Southern Italy.},

               are providing access to past paleogenomic diversity, but the
               diverse functions and biosynthetic capabilities of this growing
               paleome remain largely elusive. Here, we investigated the dental
               calculus of 12 Neanderthals and 52 anatomically modern humans
               spanning 100 kya to the present and reconstructed 459 bacterial
               metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). We identified a biosynthetic
               gene cluster (BGC) shared by seven Middle and Upper Paleolithic
               individuals that allows for the heterologous production of a
               class of previously unknown metabolites we name paleofurans. This
               paleobiotechnological approach demonstrates that viable
               biosynthetic machinery can be produced from the preserved genetic
               material of ancient organisms, allowing access to natural
               products from the Pleistocene and providing a promising area for
               natural product exploration.},
