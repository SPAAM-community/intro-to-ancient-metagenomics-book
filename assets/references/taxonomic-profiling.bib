               providing clean data for downstream analysis. Traditionally, a
               different tool is used for each operation, such as quality
               control, adapter trimming and quality filtering. These tools are
               often insufficiently fast as most are developed using high-level
               programming languages (e.g. Python and Java) and provide limited
               multi-threading support. Reading and loading data multiple times
               also renders preprocessing slow and I/O inefficient.We developed
               fastp as an ultra-fast FASTQ preprocessor with useful quality
               control and data-filtering features. It can perform quality
               control, adapter trimming, quality filtering, per-read quality
               pruning and many other operations with a single scan of the FASTQ
               data. This tool is developed in C++ and has multi-threading
               support. Based on our evaluation, fastp is 2–5 times faster than
               other FASTQ preprocessing tools such as Trimmomatic or Cutadapt

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: A critical output of metagenomic studies is the
               estimation of abundances of taxonomical or functional groups. The
               inherent uncertainty in assignments to these groups makes it
               important to consider both their hierarchical contexts and their
               prediction confidence. The current tools for visualizing
               metagenomic data, however, omit or distort quantitative
               hierarchical relationships and lack the facility for displaying
               secondary variables. RESULTS: Here we present Krona, a new
               visualization tool that allows intuitive exploration of relative
               abundances and confidences within the complex hierarchies of
               metagenomic classifications. Krona combines a variant of radial,
               space-filling displays with parametric coloring and interactive
               polar-coordinate zooming. The HTML5 and JavaScript implementation
               enables fully interactive charts that can be explored with any
               modern Web browser, without the need for installed software or
               plug-ins. This Web-based architecture also allows each chart to
               be an independent document, making them easy to share via e-mail
               or post to a standard Web server. To illustrate Krona's utility,
               we describe its application to various metagenomic data sets and
               its compatibility with popular metagenomic analysis tools.
               CONCLUSIONS: Krona is both a powerful metagenomic visualization
               tool and a demonstration of the potential of HTML5 for highly
               accessible bioinformatic visualizations. Its rich and interactive
               displays facilitate more informed interpretations of metagenomic
               analyses, while its implementation as a browser-based application
               makes it extremely portable and easily adopted into existing
               analysis packages. Both the Krona rendering code and conversion
               tools are freely available under a BSD open-source license, and
               available from: http://krona.sourceforge.net.},
