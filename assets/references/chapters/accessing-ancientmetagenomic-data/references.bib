            chromosomal and autosomal polymorphisms in a total of 162 papers
            on ancient human DNA published between 1988 and 2013. The
            estimated sharing rate was not far from totality (97.6\% ± 2.1\%)
            and substantially higher than observed in other fields of genetic
            research (evolutionary, medical and forensic genetics). Both a
            questionnaire-based survey and the examination of Journals'
            editorial policies suggest that this high sharing rate cannot be
            simply explained by the need to comply with stakeholders requests.
            Most data were made available through body text, but the use of
            primary databases increased in coincidence with the introduction
            of complete mitochondrial and next-generation sequencing methods.
            Our study highlights three important aspects. First, our results
            imply that researchers' awareness of the importance of openness
            and transparency for scientific progress may complement
            stakeholders' policies in achieving very high sharing rates.
            Second, widespread data sharing does not necessarily coincide with
            a prevalent use of practices which maximize data findability,
            accessibility, useability and preservation. A detailed look at the
            different ways in which data are released can be very useful to
            detect failures to adopt the best sharing modalities and
            understand how to correct them. Third and finally, the case of
            human paleogenetics tells us that a widespread awareness of the
            importance of Open Science may be important to build reliable
            scientific practices even in the presence of complex experimental
            challenges.",
