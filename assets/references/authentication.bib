  abstract = {Analysis of microbial data from archaeological samples is a
              rapidly growing field with a great potential for understanding
              ancient environments, lifestyles and disease spread in the past.
              However, high error rates have been a long-standing challenge in
              ancient metagenomics analysis. This is also complicated by a
              limited choice of ancient microbiome specific computational
              frameworks that meet the growing computational demands of the
              field. Here, we propose aMeta, an accurate ancient Metagenomic
              profiling workflow designed primarily to minimize the amount of
              false discoveries and computer memory requirements. Using
              simulated ancient metagenomic samples, we benchmark aMeta against
              a current state-of-the-art workflow, and demonstrate its superior
              sensitivity and specificity in both microbial detection and
              authentication, as well as substantially lower usage of computer
              memory. aMeta is implemented as a Snakemake workflow to facilitate
              use and reproducibility. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The
